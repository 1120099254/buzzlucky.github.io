You will have heard of its investors, Interactive Brokers who owns 9.5% and XiaoMi who owns 14.1%. Their achievements include being awarded 2017 Fintech 250 by CB Insights, and shortlisted for China Leading Fintech 50 for 2 years in a row. Tiger Brokers is listed in Nasdaq in 2019 with the ticker symbol TIGR, reported their first net profit despite the pandemic. As of September 2019, it had about 600k customers worldwide with a trading volume of $37.5 billion in that quarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1:24 - Commission And Fees&lt;br /&gt;For Singapore market, Tiger Brokers charges 0.08% with no minimum. Whereas Singapore’s cheapest broker is Standard Chartered which charges 0.2% with minimum SGD10. Tiger Broker wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;US market, Tiger Brokers charges USD0.01 per share with USD1.99 minimum. But TD Ameritrade just announced that they won’t charge any commission for US stock. TD Ameritrade wins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hong Kong market, Tiger Brokers charges 0.06% with minimum HKD15. Interactive Brokers is 0.08% with minimum HKD18. Tiger Brokers is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currency conversion fees, Tiger Brokers do not have any charges while Interactive Brokers charges USD2 per conversion. Tiger Brokers is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I feel these are just promotional rates to attract new sign ups, and Tiger Brokers may revert back to their normal rate after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2:46 - Is Tiger Brokers safe?&lt;br /&gt;With many countries banning apps and phones from China, naturally everyone is wary of Tiger Brokers. Based on what I found online, Tiger Brokers do not hold out stocks, instead they use DBS as their custodian service provider for Singapore market and Interactive Brokers for other markets. Similar to Robo Advisors, which uses a custodian to hold the investments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s also good to know if Tiger Brokers is being regulated by MAS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3:34 - Tiger Brokers markets&lt;br /&gt;Currently you can only use it to trade Singapore, US, HK and China stocks, and futures. However, London Stock Exchange is missing, which is a big issue because I buy Ireland Domiciled ETF from London. That’s because Ireland Domiciled ETF only tax 15% on your dividends, but you have to pay 30% withholding tax on US stocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4:04 - Signup Process&lt;br /&gt;With Singpass, the signup process is really fast and took less than 10 minutes. The approval was done within 1 day too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4:26 - User Interface Review&lt;br /&gt;TigerBrokers is available on Apple app, Mac, GooglePlay app and Windows, however they do not have a web platform. The UI is very fluid and intuitive to use. It has many features which other brokers do not have. However, it still has some minor translation bugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8:38 - Signup Promos&lt;br /&gt;Tiger Brokers is running some promotions for new sign ups. You will get nice stuff like free market depth for 30 days, free 1 commission trade for US &amp;amp; HK stocks within 30 days, free $100 worth of stock vouchers and you deposit funds or refer friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9:01 - What I Like&lt;br /&gt;1. The UI is incredibly good. Dark mode, no noticeable lags. I feel that their UI is among the best among other Singapore brokers.&lt;br /&gt;2. Good customer support. There are lots of reviews that the customer support replies within a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;3. Low fees. Tiger Brokers has one of the lowest fees among all Singapore brokers. But they might raise their fees in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9:40 - What I don’t like&lt;br /&gt;1. Tiger Brokers do not have London Stock Exchange yet&lt;br /&gt;2. They are still relatively new. I am still cautious about putting my entire wealth in it, for now. Their website doesn’t state what will happen in case Tiger Brokers goes bankrupt. Unlike Interactive Brokers which is insured with SIPC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll give it some time and see if Tiger Brokers is really good or not. If they are good, i’m sure that they will be one of the best brokers around here.\r\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cSbmfT2Usqg/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-08-10T00:45:00Z", "duration": "PT10M49S", "contentUrl": "https://buzzlucky.github.io/videos/watch/tiger-brokers-review-best-singapore-broker", "interactionCount": "8571" }

You will have heard of its investors, Interactive Brokers who owns 9.5% and XiaoMi who owns 14.1%. Their achievements include being awarded 2017 Fintech 250 by CB Insights, and shortlisted for China Leading Fintech 50 for 2 years in a row. Tiger Brokers is listed in Nasdaq in 2019 with the ticker symbol TIGR, reported their first net profit despite the pandemic. As of September 2019, it had about 600k customers worldwide with a trading volume of $37.5 billion in that quarter.<br /><br />1:24 - Commission And Fees<br />For Singapore market, Tiger Brokers charges 0.08% with no minimum. Whereas Singapore’s cheapest broker is Standard Chartered which charges 0.2% with minimum SGD10. Tiger Broker wins.<br /><br />US market, Tiger Brokers charges USD0.01 per share with USD1.99 minimum. But TD Ameritrade just announced that they won’t charge any commission for US stock. TD Ameritrade wins.<br /><br />Hong Kong market, Tiger Brokers charges 0.06% with minimum HKD15. Interactive Brokers is 0.08% with minimum HKD18. Tiger Brokers is cheaper.<br /><br />Currency conversion fees, Tiger Brokers do not have any charges while Interactive Brokers charges USD2 per conversion. Tiger Brokers is cheaper.<br /><br />However, I feel these are just promotional rates to attract new sign ups, and Tiger Brokers may revert back to their normal rate after a while.<br /><br />2:46 - Is Tiger Brokers safe?<br />With many countries banning apps and phones from China, naturally everyone is wary of Tiger Brokers. Based on what I found online, Tiger Brokers do not hold out stocks, instead they use DBS as their custodian service provider for Singapore market and Interactive Brokers for other markets. Similar to Robo Advisors, which uses a custodian to hold the investments.<br /><br />It’s also good to know if Tiger Brokers is being regulated by MAS.<br /><br />3:34 - Tiger Brokers markets<br />Currently you can only use it to trade Singapore, US, HK and China stocks, and futures. However, London Stock Exchange is missing, which is a big issue because I buy Ireland Domiciled ETF from London. That’s because Ireland Domiciled ETF only tax 15% on your dividends, but you have to pay 30% withholding tax on US stocks.<br /><br />4:04 - Signup Process<br />With Singpass, the signup process is really fast and took less than 10 minutes. The approval was done within 1 day too.<br /><br />4:26 - User Interface Review<br />TigerBrokers is available on Apple app, Mac, GooglePlay app and Windows, however they do not have a web platform. The UI is very fluid and intuitive to use. It has many features which other brokers do not have. However, it still has some minor translation bugs.<br /><br />8:38 - Signup Promos<br />Tiger Brokers is running some promotions for new sign ups. You will get nice stuff like free market depth for 30 days, free 1 commission trade for US &amp; HK stocks within 30 days, free $100 worth of stock vouchers and you deposit funds or refer friends.<br /><br />9:01 - What I Like<br />1. The UI is incredibly good. Dark mode, no noticeable lags. I feel that their UI is among the best among other Singapore brokers.<br />2. Good customer support. There are lots of reviews that the customer support replies within a few hours.<br />3. Low fees. Tiger Brokers has one of the lowest fees among all Singapore brokers. But they might raise their fees in the future.<br /><br />9:40 - What I don’t like<br />1. Tiger Brokers do not have London Stock Exchange yet<br />2. They are still relatively new. I am still cautious about putting my entire wealth in it, for now. Their website doesn’t state what will happen in case Tiger Brokers goes bankrupt. Unlike Interactive Brokers which is insured with SIPC.<br /><br />I’ll give it some time and see if Tiger Brokers is really good or not. If they are good, i’m sure that they will be one of the best brokers around here.
