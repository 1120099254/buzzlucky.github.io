Despite the fact they've seen better days, we have such a strong bond I still wear them.&quot;<br /><br />04:30 - Bob Mortimer: &quot;The police once ordered me to leave town because I was frightening the locals.&quot;<br /><br />10:50 - James Acaster: &quot;I once spent the night in a bush in Basingstoke.&quot;<br /><br />16:18 - Reginald D.

Once it's in, I never forget it&quot;<br /><br />28:49 - David O'Doherty: &quot;This is one of the pairs of leg-warmers for birds that I have made. I would have brought more, but birds are using them.&quot;<br /><br />31:49 - Gabby Logan: &quot;This is Mick, and I deliberately tripped him up during the wheelbarrow race at my son's sports day.&quot;<br />            James Acaster: &quot;This is Mick, and for six months, he was my sworn enemy when a practical joke got out of hand.&quot;<br />             Lee Mack: &quot;This is Mick. I once took him home from nursery instead of my own son.&quot; <br /><br />43:55 - Lee Mack: &quot;When I was seven, I had to be a bridesmaid at my auntie's wedding, as one of the girls who was supposed to do it was ill and the dress was a perfect fit.&quot;<br /><br />48:01 - Greg Davies: &quot;I once caused an injury to one man whilst trying to get a different man to say the word &quot;Vegetables&quot;.&quot;<br /><br />53:15 - Lee Mack: &quot;I recently took a crash course in taxidermy, by the end of which, I'd managed to make this.<br /><br />59:30 - Henning Wehn: &quot;I was once arrested by border guards for illegally entering another country.&quot;<br /><br />1:04:42 - David Mitchell: &quot;There is something about me that elephants like. Every time I visit a zoo, they thunder towards me and point their trunks in my direction.&quot;<br /><br />1:07:50 - Mel Giedroyc: &quot;I once had a snog with one of the people here on Would I Lie to You tonight.&quot;<br /><br />1:13:20 - Bob Mortimer: &quot;This is the cushion that I used to carry my pet owl around on. I would have brought the owl, but he escaped last week.&quot;<br /><br />1:18:39 - Rhod Gilbert: &quot;I once had a job where I had to answer the phone and say, 'Hello. Beef.'&quot;<br /><br />1:21:41 - Lee Mack: &quot;One Saturday morning, I lay on my back in the garden and pretended I'd fallen off a ladder so I could get out of a family trip to Ikea.&quot;<br /><br />1:27:10 - David Mitchell: &quot;I've had to prise open my bedroom door for the last two years ever since the door handle fell off.&quot;<br /><br />1:30:08 - Katherine Ryan: &quot;My motto is 'Never give a child a one-syllable name', because life has taught me that people with one-syllable names are generally dim.&quot;<br /><br />1:35:00 - Bob Mortimer: &quot;For the past 15 years, I have performed my own dentistry.&quot;<br /><br />1:41:58 - Lee Mack: &quot;When my kids were younger, I designed a special system for remembering which Teletubby was which.&quot;<br /><br />1:46:32 - Lee Mack: &quot;Having recently got into Eastern cuisine, this Christmas sees the launch of my new cookbook, Lee Mack's Wok Around The Clock.&quot;<br /><br />1:52:47 - Outro - This is Jinsy - Female Badger (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYeL2i9NDn8)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYeL2i9NDn8)</a><br /><br />WILTY BEST BITS UPDATED PART 2 SERIES 11
