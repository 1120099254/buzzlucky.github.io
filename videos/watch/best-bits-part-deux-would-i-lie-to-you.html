Once it's in, I never forget it&quot;<br /><br />28:49 - David O'Doherty: &quot;This is one of the pairs of leg-warmers for birds that I have made.

I once took him home from nursery instead of my own son.&quot; <br /><br />43:55 - Lee Mack: &quot;When I was seven, I had to be a bridesmaid at my auntie's wedding, as one of the girls who was supposed to do it was ill and the dress was a perfect fit.&quot;<br /><br />48:01 - Greg Davies: &quot;I once caused an injury to one man whilst trying to get a different man to say the word &quot;Vegetables&quot;.&quot;<br /><br />53:15 - Lee Mack: &quot;I recently took a crash course in taxidermy, by the end of which, I'd managed to make this.<br /><br />59:30 - Henning Wehn: &quot;I was once arrested by border guards for illegally entering another country.&quot;<br /><br />1:04:42 - David Mitchell: &quot;There is something about me that elephants like.
