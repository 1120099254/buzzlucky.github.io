A spacious master bedroom with personal balcony and stunning views across the city, built-in dressing area and en-suite bathroom. Generous sized second bedroom, and a smaller third room that could be used as a bedroom, an office or storage, up to you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entertaining space in the condo is spacious, bright and functional. Its generously proportioned kitchen/living/dining area leads on to a balcony offering stunning views of the Doi Suthep Mountain Range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don’t miss out on this luxury, modern condo that’s ready to move into being sold fully furnished and equipped with full air-con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Located northwest of the Old City at the junction of Huay Kaew Road and the Super Highway, Hillside 4 Condo comes with 24 hour security, gym, swimming pool and underground car parking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is more information on the Hillside 4 condominium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To view, please contact:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT HOMES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flanking Hillside 4 and unveiled only last month is the open-air evening flea market, ‘Nimman Night’; occupying almost as much land as the condo itself and comprising dozens of covered stalls complete with rustic hay bales for sitting, vendors peddle their assorted wares (food, drink, clothing, household plants, handicrafts and other knick-knacks) until 10PM every night. On the opposing side of Hillside 4 lies a small soi [lane or side street] which leads to the aircraft hangar sized Su Khon Tha Mu Katha (more often written as Sukontha Mookata), the quintessential Thai barbeque buffet experience in Chiang Mai; open Monday to Sunday from 5PM to midnight and costing only a smidge over 200 baht for an all-you-can-feast accompanied by live music, diners can choose from an almost mind-numbing selection of fresh seafood and shellfish, meats and raw vegetables as well as scores of prepared dishes, Thai salads, fruit plates, dipping sauces and even desserts and non-alcoholic beverages. Reachable in less than five minutes on foot from the condo is the futuristic-looking Maya Lifestyle Shopping Centre and, across from which, fashionable Nimmanhaemin Road with its mix of trendy bars, eateries, cafés and boutique retail concerns. En route to the ‘Old City’ and barely a 10 minute stroll from Hillside 4 is the supremely utilitarian Kad Suan Kaew, one of Chiang Mai’s very first malls and, to this day, still ever-bustling especially with Thai folk; home to several hundred shops and restaurants, the mall also anchors a Central department store, branches of Tops Market and IT City, two main food courts, a gym, bowling alley and private karaoke cubicles as well as a seven-screen multiplex cinema (though very few films are now presented in English) and, thrice weekly, a delightful night market (Kad Sum Murd) with pop-up stands hawking an array of hearty local fare in addition to cut-price clothing. Onward, a further five minute walk, from the mall is Chiang Mai Ram Hospital and long regarded as the preeminent –if the most expensive- medical hub in the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More information on living in Thailand here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://perfecthomes.co.th/chaing-mai...&quot;&gt;https://perfecthomes.co.th/chaing-mai...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**More properties for sale - &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://perfecthomes.co.th/property-t...&quot;&gt;https://perfecthomes.co.th/property-t...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Top 5 things to consider when looking to purchase a house here in Chiang Mai or anywhere in Thailand for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://perfecthomes.co.th/top-5-thin...&quot;&gt;https://perfecthomes.co.th/top-5-thin...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prices are fixed in Thai Baht and can be subject to change without any prior notice.

A spacious master bedroom with personal balcony and stunning views across the city, built-in dressing area and en-suite bathroom. Generous sized second bedroom, and a smaller third room that could be used as a bedroom, an office or storage, up to you!<br /><br />The entertaining space in the condo is spacious, bright and functional. Its generously proportioned kitchen/living/dining area leads on to a balcony offering stunning views of the Doi Suthep Mountain Range.<br /><br />Don’t miss out on this luxury, modern condo that’s ready to move into being sold fully furnished and equipped with full air-con.<br /><br />Located northwest of the Old City at the junction of Huay Kaew Road and the Super Highway, Hillside 4 Condo comes with 24 hour security, gym, swimming pool and underground car parking.<br /><br />Here is more information on the Hillside 4 condominium.<br /><br />To view, please contact:<br /><br />PERFECT HOMES<br /><br />Flanking Hillside 4 and unveiled only last month is the open-air evening flea market, ‘Nimman Night’; occupying almost as much land as the condo itself and comprising dozens of covered stalls complete with rustic hay bales for sitting, vendors peddle their assorted wares (food, drink, clothing, household plants, handicrafts and other knick-knacks) until 10PM every night. On the opposing side of Hillside 4 lies a small soi [lane or side street] which leads to the aircraft hangar sized Su Khon Tha Mu Katha (more often written as Sukontha Mookata), the quintessential Thai barbeque buffet experience in Chiang Mai; open Monday to Sunday from 5PM to midnight and costing only a smidge over 200 baht for an all-you-can-feast accompanied by live music, diners can choose from an almost mind-numbing selection of fresh seafood and shellfish, meats and raw vegetables as well as scores of prepared dishes, Thai salads, fruit plates, dipping sauces and even desserts and non-alcoholic beverages. Reachable in less than five minutes on foot from the condo is the futuristic-looking Maya Lifestyle Shopping Centre and, across from which, fashionable Nimmanhaemin Road with its mix of trendy bars, eateries, cafés and boutique retail concerns. En route to the ‘Old City’ and barely a 10 minute stroll from Hillside 4 is the supremely utilitarian Kad Suan Kaew, one of Chiang Mai’s very first malls and, to this day, still ever-bustling especially with Thai folk; home to several hundred shops and restaurants, the mall also anchors a Central department store, branches of Tops Market and IT City, two main food courts, a gym, bowling alley and private karaoke cubicles as well as a seven-screen multiplex cinema (though very few films are now presented in English) and, thrice weekly, a delightful night market (Kad Sum Murd) with pop-up stands hawking an array of hearty local fare in addition to cut-price clothing. Onward, a further five minute walk, from the mall is Chiang Mai Ram Hospital and long regarded as the preeminent –if the most expensive- medical hub in the city.<br /><br /><br />More information on living in Thailand here<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://perfecthomes.co.th/chaing-mai...">https://perfecthomes.co.th/chaing-mai...</a><br /><br />**More properties for sale - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://perfecthomes.co.th/property-t...">https://perfecthomes.co.th/property-t...</a><br /><br />**Top 5 things to consider when looking to purchase a house here in Chiang Mai or anywhere in Thailand for that matter.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://perfecthomes.co.th/top-5-thin...">https://perfecthomes.co.th/top-5-thin...</a><br /><br />Disclaimer<br /><br />Prices are fixed in Thai Baht and can be subject to change without any prior notice.
