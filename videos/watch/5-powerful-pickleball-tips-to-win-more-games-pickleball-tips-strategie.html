Whether you are intermediate, advanced, or new to the pickleball game, these tips will help you improve your skills as a pickleball player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to go over some tips to help you improve as a pickleball player. Some tips are simple and some are a bit complicated but these tips will help you improve your pickleball play, your pickleball results and improve you as a big ballplayer&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Pickleball Tip No. 1: Follow the Ball&lt;br /&gt;Two things that I want to focus on. One, I want to make sure that when I hit a shot particularly on the 3rd shot, or if my partner is hitting the 3rd shot, I want to make sure that I&#39;m closing on the ball. What I don&#39;t want to do it, is come in straight when the ball is over to one side or come into one side. I want to make sure that I&#39;m turning my shoulders to the ball, depending on where the ball is at. What happens a lot of times when we&#39;re playing up with a no volley zone as we stand square to the net and we don&#39;t turn our body to where the ball is coming from or where the ball is. And so, what happens is the ball can basically get behind us or create a difficult angle for us. Check out the practical view from the Pickleball Tip video, you will learn properly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pickleball Tip No. 2: Use a Compact Swing&lt;br /&gt;Compact swing means you are avoiding errors from backswing and you also avoid errors from just having your paddle flailing about. You want to play pickleball aggressively but with some amount of control. Basically, if I have a nice short backswing on most of my strokes and I want to have a follow that makes sense. I don&#39;t want to have a follow-through that goes all the way around my body. Please watch the Pickleball Tip video with the practical view, it will help you to understand this tip perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pickleball Tip No. 3: Anticipate the Ball&lt;br /&gt;It basically involves anticipating where the ball is going to be before it gets to you. And even before it crosses the net. So, you have more time to move around the pickleball court and get into a position to hit your next shot. You need to look at a few different things. One thing you need to look at the type of stroke that your opponent is hitting. &lt;br /&gt;Your opponent is dinking or not and the current condition of the wind. These are important elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pickleball Tip No. 4: Point of Contact&lt;br /&gt;Every shot has an optimal point of contact. And if we were able to put every shot into a computer program it would tell us to hit the ball when the pickleball is right here or when the pickleball is right here depending on the type of shot and depending on the trajectory speed of the ball. It&#39;s very difficult as humans to always hit it on the actual optimal point of contact but we want to try and get as close to that point as possible. Please watch the Pickleball Tip video with the practical view, it will help you to understand this tip perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus Tip: Grip Pressure Serve &amp;amp; Return&lt;br /&gt;The Grip pressure, how you hold the pickleball paddle, how hard you hold it, or how lightly you hold it. When we talk about grip pressure, we talk about grip pressure being one to ten. Ten is death grip, no one holds at a ten. It would be painful to do so. Watch the video for this bonus pickleball tip to understand perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Jill and Laurie for their help with the video - these things take a minute to film out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks as well to Kolter Homes for allowing us to film this video at their new pickleball facility at PGA Village Verano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck out there!&lt;br /&gt;Tony&lt;br /&gt;In2Pickle Player Development&lt;br /&gt;Tony@In2Pickle.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Coyote Hearing Studio for the music used in this video.

Whether you are intermediate, advanced, or new to the pickleball game, these tips will help you improve your skills as a pickleball player.<br /><br />I want to go over some tips to help you improve as a pickleball player. Some tips are simple and some are a bit complicated but these tips will help you improve your pickleball play, your pickleball results and improve you as a big ballplayer<br />.<br />Pickleball Tip No. 1: Follow the Ball<br />Two things that I want to focus on. One, I want to make sure that when I hit a shot particularly on the 3rd shot, or if my partner is hitting the 3rd shot, I want to make sure that I'm closing on the ball. What I don't want to do it, is come in straight when the ball is over to one side or come into one side. I want to make sure that I'm turning my shoulders to the ball, depending on where the ball is at. What happens a lot of times when we're playing up with a no volley zone as we stand square to the net and we don't turn our body to where the ball is coming from or where the ball is. And so, what happens is the ball can basically get behind us or create a difficult angle for us. Check out the practical view from the Pickleball Tip video, you will learn properly. <br /><br /><br />Pickleball Tip No. 2: Use a Compact Swing<br />Compact swing means you are avoiding errors from backswing and you also avoid errors from just having your paddle flailing about. You want to play pickleball aggressively but with some amount of control. Basically, if I have a nice short backswing on most of my strokes and I want to have a follow that makes sense. I don't want to have a follow-through that goes all the way around my body. Please watch the Pickleball Tip video with the practical view, it will help you to understand this tip perfectly.<br /><br /><br />Pickleball Tip No. 3: Anticipate the Ball<br />It basically involves anticipating where the ball is going to be before it gets to you. And even before it crosses the net. So, you have more time to move around the pickleball court and get into a position to hit your next shot. You need to look at a few different things. One thing you need to look at the type of stroke that your opponent is hitting. <br />Your opponent is dinking or not and the current condition of the wind. These are important elements.<br /><br />Pickleball Tip No. 4: Point of Contact<br />Every shot has an optimal point of contact. And if we were able to put every shot into a computer program it would tell us to hit the ball when the pickleball is right here or when the pickleball is right here depending on the type of shot and depending on the trajectory speed of the ball. It's very difficult as humans to always hit it on the actual optimal point of contact but we want to try and get as close to that point as possible. Please watch the Pickleball Tip video with the practical view, it will help you to understand this tip perfectly.<br />Bonus Tip: Grip Pressure Serve &amp; Return<br />The Grip pressure, how you hold the pickleball paddle, how hard you hold it, or how lightly you hold it. When we talk about grip pressure, we talk about grip pressure being one to ten. Ten is death grip, no one holds at a ten. It would be painful to do so.
