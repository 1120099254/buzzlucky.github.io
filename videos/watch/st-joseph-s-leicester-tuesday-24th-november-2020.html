Fr John has begun to resume his streamed mass, having been unwell and in hospital for several weeks.  He is starting cautiously, celebrating mass on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10.30 am on each of those days, with the plan to resume daily mass when he is stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All music used in this streamed recording is used under license and with permission.

Some is played on the various available instruments in the church, and the sheet music copyright of tunes is given. Some of the music is from commercial recordings owned by Watermead Music, who have white-listed this channel, which allows us permission for their recordings to be used (see below). During the Cornavirus (COVID-19) lock-down of churches we may also use recordings of hymns sung by our own congregations at previous celebrations of mass, that have been streamed live from St Joseph&#39;s, Leicester.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following are the relevant permission statements as regards our use of music.&lt;br /&gt;Permission to podcast/stream the music in this service obtained from ONE LICENSE, License No. 731191-A and by agreement with Watermead Music &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.watermead-apostolate.co.uk/watermead-music&quot;&gt;https://www.watermead-apostolate.co.uk/watermead-music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the difficult times of the Covid-19 pandemic we hope that our broadcasts have helped to bring a little peace and hope into your prayer at home. We are aware that as churches around the country (and world) re-open, people will start returning to their own parish churches for mass. Our streaming of Fr John&#39;s mass will continue, whether this is of a public mass or a private mass, and we welcome all who would still like to join us - we wish you all a prayerful and blessed celebration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MASS TIMES AFTER CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN&lt;br /&gt;Our timetable will be different to the one we had before the pandemic, but, until Fr John is fully recovered, we cannot make plans for any public celebration of mass. As soon as we do the programme will be posted here and on our parish website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Permission to podcast/stream the music in this service obtained from&lt;br /&gt;ONE LICENSE, License No.731191-A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hymn book we use is &amp;quot;The Laudate Hymnal&amp;quot; from Decani Music (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.decanimusic.co.uk)&quot;&gt;https://www.decanimusic.co.uk)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All other music or is from WATERMEAD MUSIC (see &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.watermead-apostolate.co.uk/watermead_music.html&quot;&gt;http://www.watermead-apostolate.co.uk/watermead_music.html&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.watermeadshop.co.uk/).&quot;&gt;https://www.watermeadshop.co.uk/).&lt;/a&gt; Some of Watermead Music is available to stream or download through YouTube Music,  iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, etc. (search &amp;quot;Alison Kennedy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Watermead Music&amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further details on St Joseph&#39;s Parish can be accessed via our parish website (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.stjoseph-leicester.btck.co.uk/)&quot;&gt;http://www.stjoseph-leicester.btck.co.uk/)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel welcome to leave us a comment.\r\n", "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zFOrCoM4518/hqdefault.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-11-24T11:34:50Z", "duration": "PT51M5S", "contentUrl": "https://buzzlucky.github.io/videos/watch/st-joseph-s-leicester-tuesday-24th-november-2020", "interactionCount": "120" }

                        <div class="py-1 d-md-block bwr" id="video-description">WELCOME to St Joseph's, Leicester, for our celebration of mass. Fr John has begun to resume his streamed mass, having been unwell and in hospital for several weeks.  He is starting cautiously, celebrating mass on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10.30 am on each of those days, with the plan to resume daily mass when he is stronger.<br /><br />All music used in this streamed recording is used under license and with permission.
