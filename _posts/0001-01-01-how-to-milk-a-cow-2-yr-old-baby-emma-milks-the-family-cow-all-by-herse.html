Emma was staying with her parents in our basement apartment for about 3 years. She would come out with me in the morning and in the evening to help me milk. One day she wanted to try and milk the cow by herself. I was impressed by her determination to not quit. (for licensing or usage, contact: licensing@viralhog.com
