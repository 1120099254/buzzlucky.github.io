Paloma Faith) <br /><br />[Intro]<br />When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again<br />Same mistakes again, for you?<br />When will I learn to lock my heart so it doesn't break again, no?<br />Doesn't break again, in two<br /><br />[Verse 1]<br />I should've known, should've known by now<br />That I was gonna come back around, see<br />Back in the day you know you let me down<br />Thought maybe I finally figured you out, 'cause<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />We said that things would be different<br />But all that turns out to be fiction<br />Breaking dishes in the kitchen<br />Walking on glass of pain<br />You say it's space that you needed<br />I said, &quot;Well fuck it I'm leaving&quot;<br />But history keeps on repeating<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again<br />Same mistakes again, for you<br />When will I learn to lock my heart so it doesn't break again, no?<br />Doesn't break again, in two<br />When will I learn that I, I can do better<br />I can do better, much better than you?<br />When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again?<br />Over and over again, over and over again<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />I'm all out of new words to say (Words to say)<br />Running on empty, out of reasons to stay (To stay)<br />My friends told me it would go this way<br />They call me stupid when I say that you've changed, but<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />You said that things would be different<br />But all that turns out to be fiction<br />History keeps on repeating<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again<br />Same mistakes again, for you?<br />When will I learn to lock my heart so it doesn't break again, no?<br />Doesn't break again, in two<br />When will I learn that I, I can do better<br />I can do better, much better than you?<br />When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again?<br />Over and over again, over and over again<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />I should know better, I should know better<br />I should know better, tell me why, yeah<br />I can't remember, I can't remember<br />The way he hurts me every time<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />When will I learn that I, I can do better<br />I can do better, much better than you?<br />When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again?<br />Over and over again, over and over again<br /><br />[Outro]<br />When will I learn to stop me making the same mistakes again<br />Same mistakes again, for you?<br />When will I learn to lock my heart so it doesn't break again, no?<br />Doesn't break again, in two<br /><br />.........<br />📷 Wallpaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a><br />.........<br />📧 Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org<br />.........<br />💌 Demos / Music Submissions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com">https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com</a><br />.........<br /><br />#JonasBlue #PalomaFaith #Mistakes #Lyrics
