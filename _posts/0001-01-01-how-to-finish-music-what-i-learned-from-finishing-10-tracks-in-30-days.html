YouTube recently got in touch and asked me to contribute 10 tracks to their YouTube Audio Library. I only had 30 days to finish the 10 tracks so I had to have very good systems in place for being able to draft ideas quickly and get tracks finished. In this video I share some tips, tricks and techniques I use to get from a collection of loops and ideas to a finished piece of music.<br /><br />► LISTEN TO THE 10 YOUTUBE AUDIO LIBRARY TRACKS AT:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://elphnt.io/youtube-audio">https://elphnt.io/youtube-audio</a> (search for ELPHNT)<br /><br />You can download them for free and use them in your own videos. <br /><br />— — — — — — — — <br /><br />💬 QUESTIONS?<br />Post them in the comments below.<br /><br />❤️ SHOW SOME LOVE<br />Keep these videos coming by supporting what I do at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://elphnt.io">https://elphnt.io</a><br /><br />💌 JOIN THE MAKING MUSIC NEWSLETTER<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://elphnt.io/newsletter/">https://elphnt.io/newsletter/</a><br /><br />📱 GET SOCIAL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/elphntx">https://www.instagram.com/elphntx</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/elphntx/">https://www.facebook.com/elphntx/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ELPHNTx">https://twitter.com/ELPHNTx</a><br /><br />— — — — — — — — <br /><br />Hi 👋🏻 my name is Tom; I’m a music maker and Ableton Certified Trainer.
