You will see that lot of conversation are similar to your life, but if you really want to improve your spoken English skills then after watching the video try to make at least five sentences from your practical life conversation without getting worried of English grammar.<br />If you try this you will see a significant improvement is happening in your spoken English skill.<br /><br />Follow this four steps to learn English faster.<br /><br />1. Read and write daily for at least 1 hour at your level, means you can start with simple English story books which is made for kids.<br /><br />2.  Try to clear you all doubts regarding basic English grammar.<br /><br />3. Regularly watch and follow dadar i school videos on different topics like: present tense, past tense, future tense, parts of speech, modal verb, voice changae, narration, articles, spoken english practice class etc and practice as per the instruction.<br /><br />4. Find a partner and start speaking in English. If nobody is there start self talking.<br /><br />*note for learners: If you are just watching the videos and not practicing afterwards or not following the steps suggested in the videos you will not get desired output.<br /> *note for critics: I am not an English teacher neither I am challenging my knowledge of English language with anyone, rather I am still learning from others and from my own mistakes and helping other learners from the experience my own journey of learning English. So instead of wasting your valuable time by negative criticizing respect your time and make use of it.  <br /><br />* feed backs, suggestion, neutral criticisms are always welcome.<br /><br />Thank you for being here and reading the description.<br />Take care and keep learning.
