If you’ve ever seen a news story about a scientific study, you’ve probably heard something like “statistically significant results.” More likely than not, what this is referring to is a scientific study that found something like p is less than .05.  In this video I’m going to do two things: first, I’m going to explain what it means when someone says that something like “statistically significant result,” then I’ll give you an intuitive explanation of what those p-values are and, finally, if you stick around to the end of this video,  I’m going to explain why we use a threshold of .05 and not, say, .04 or .08 or .15 or anything else when determining statistical significance.<br /><br /><br />Learn more about who I am and why I'm doing this here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/sLIquDwwTpw">https://youtu.be/sLIquDwwTpw</a><br /><br />Video that has more detail randomized experiments: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/TOoSq8jYBFo">https://youtu.be/TOoSq8jYBFo</a><br /><br />Follow me at:<br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-galak-768a193a">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-galak-768a193a</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/datademystified">https://www.patreon.com/datademystified</a> <br /><br />Equipment Used for Filming:<br />Nikon D7100: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/320N1FZ">https://amzn.to/320N1FZ</a><br />Softlight: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZaXz3o">https://amzn.to/2ZaXz3o</a><br />Yeti Microphone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZTXznB">https://amzn.to/2ZTXznB</a><br />iPad for Teleprompter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZSUkNh">https://amzn.to/2ZSUkNh</a><br />Camtasia for Video Editing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZRPeAV">https://amzn.to/2ZRPeAV</a>
