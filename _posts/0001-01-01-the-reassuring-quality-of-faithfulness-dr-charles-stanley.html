“Our sin does not nullify, or render void, the faithfulness of God.”<br />—Dr. Charles Stanley<br /><br />Sooner or later, each of us must face the reality that in our own strength we don’t measure up—we’ve all sinned and fallen short most every day of our lives. But the good news is God’s faithfulness to us has never depended on our perfection. In this message, Dr. Stanley explores four ways in which we experience God’s fidelity in keeping His promises to His children. Relax into the trustworthy character of our heavenly Father—He will never leave or forsake you.<br /><br />For more messages from Charles Stanley, including this week's broadcast, go to intouch.org/tv.
