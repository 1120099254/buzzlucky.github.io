Bridger Walker needed 90 stitches after saving his sister from a vicious dog attack. After the attack, the 6-year-old’s aunt took to social media, tagging the actors that play Bridger’s favorite superheroes in a post that went viral. Captain America himself, Chris Evans, sent Bridger an authentic shield. He even got a call from ‘Spider-Man’ star Tom Holland, who confirmed that there would be a third Spider-Man film, and invited Bridger’s family to set.
