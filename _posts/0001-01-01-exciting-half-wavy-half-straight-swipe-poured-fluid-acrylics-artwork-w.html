All the paints I use are acrylic paints mixed with additives to help them flow more easily. All my colors are stored and mixed in squeeze bottles for ease of use. I have applied colorful stripes with my squeeze bottles in a zig-zag pattern. My swipe tool is a  damp cotton rag made from a tee shirt hem. I  dip it into a heavy layer of black at one end of the canvas and let it become saturated where the hem is. I  drag the swipe cloth from one end over the colorful stripes. Halfway through the swipe, I wave the swipe tool to create a wavy pattern. I used a bamboo skewer to add spirals and agitate the paint. Finally, one single spritz of RainX creates lots of tiny cells(not shown in this video).<br /><br />My &quot;pouring&quot; mixture is 3/4 Floetrol with 1/4 (estimated) GAC800 from &quot;Golden&quot; (prevents cracking and adds shine to dry artwork.)mix into it thoroughly. Depending on the paint the amounts of color can vary. I like to begin with half pouring mixture and half color. After that is mixed VERY thoroughly I add more pouring mixture until the viscosity (thickness) is like warm hone. If I want it thinner I add more Pouring mixture. If the color is not strong enough I add more pigment. <br />   When mixing colors my amounts are always estimated and then altered to get the right consistency I like. I use plastic squeeze bottles with measurements on the side.<br />  I add a marble size steel ball bearing to aid in the mixing process. Marbles work well too but exercise caution if you end up with more than one they will shatter in the mixture eventually. It's imperative (Important) that all mixture be shaken thoroughly once before using in any session the first every time! The consistency is usually medium &quot;body&quot; weight, but other weights are usable with minor adjustments.<br />   All my acrylic paints are mixed in advance and contained and stored in squeeze bottles. If you are not using squeeze bottles, I suggest using a container that has a tight-fitting lid or seal the container with Glad sticky wrap. I have often used the 4oz size plastic deli containers, and the paint keeps for a long time in them, but you must stir before using the mix again. Floetrol and other flow agents will rise to the top between uses. None of my acrylic paint has any added silicone. To create the pearlescent effects seen in most of my artworks, I use &quot;Golden's&quot; Iridescent pearl &quot;Fine&quot; added to colors. I add a good squirt directly into whatever I am mixing in. I recommend experimenting to find out how much is enough for your ideal shimmer.<br /><br />Every day I learn new things. I will never stop experimenting, and I  am happy to share what I discover with you. <br />To see finished wet and dry versions of all my Youtube demonstration artworks for sale visit my Expressionist Art Studio Gallery Fans and Collectors group on Facebook  <br /># 2849 wet.2851 dry Shown in this video.
