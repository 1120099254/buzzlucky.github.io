hi angels,<br /><br />this collab with noah schnapp was recorded before all of the craziness of having to stay at home and protect yourself and others from spreading the virus.  <br /><br />i want to remind you that we are all in this together. i know that it’s not easy but i hope that you can stay positive and stay virtually connected to your friends and family.  this will all eventually end and things will get better!! <br /><br />so for this collab, noah teaches me how to act and so you can be the judge if i pulled it off or not.  i'll just tell you this - it’s way harder than you think it is! <br /><br />i hope this video can help take your mind off of things for a few minutes and i really hope it makes you smile. <br /><br />you should also check out noah’s video where i taught him how to do popular tiktok dances.  <br /><br />watch noah’s collab video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/12JM_NXqFqM">https://youtu.be/12JM_NXqFqM</a><br /><br />Follow Noah:<br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@noahschnapp">https://www.tiktok.com/@noahschnapp</a><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/noahschnapp">https://www.instagram.com/noahschnapp</a><br />Twitter:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/noah_schnapp">https://twitter.com/noah_schnapp</a><br /><br />My Socials:<br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio">https://www.tiktok.com/@charlidamelio</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/charlidamelio/">https://www.instagram.com/charlidamelio/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/charlidamelio">http://twitter.com/charlidamelio</a><br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/charlidamelio">https://www.youtube.com/charlidamelio</a><br />website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.charlidamelio.com/">https://www.charlidamelio.com/</a><br /><br />Special thanks to Noah Schnapp, his mom Karine and Noah’s whole team for helping make this happen.  <br />Thanks to Tommy Burns for filming and editing.
