The ending credits track from Wes Anderson's &quot;Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; (2014) It is an arrangement of a famous Russian folksong called &quot;Светит месяц&quot; or &quot;The Moon Is Shining.&quot; Some mistake the bright sound of the stringed instruments to be that of mandolins but they are Russian balalaikas. <br /><br />I do not own this song. All rights go to the creators. <br /><br />Enjoy!
