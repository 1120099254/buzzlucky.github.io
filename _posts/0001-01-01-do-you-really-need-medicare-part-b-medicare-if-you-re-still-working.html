Many people should, but there are plenty of folks that could and SHOULD delay Medicare Part B - and can do so without a penalty. <br /><br />Stephanie Abt explains Medicare Part B, and reviews some situations in which you would want to DELAY or drop Medicare Part B, and how to do so. For example, if you are going to be working past age 65 you may want to delay Medicare Part B. When you DO add Medicare Part, you'll have a new Medicare Supplement Open Enrollment Period that you can take advantage of. <br /><br />Forms you'll need when you sign up for Part B if you've delayed it:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/Downloads/CMS40B-E.pdf">https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/Downloads/CMS40B-E.pdf</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/Downloads/CMS-L564E.pdf">https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/Downloads/CMS-L564E.pdf</a><br /><br />Stephanie Abt is a Medicare Consultant located in Austin, Texas.
