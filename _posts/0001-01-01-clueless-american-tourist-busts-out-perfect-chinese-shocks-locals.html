This week we are in Taiwan and I decided to play the role of a totally clueless white American tourist who only speaks English, and then prank locals by suddenly switching to fluent Mandarin Chinese. What an interesting social experiment with funny reactions!<br /><br />This is part 1 of our language learning videos in Chinese in Taiwan — next time we will be exploring the street markets of Taipei and I’ll be putting my Chinese to the test to an even greater degree, by trying to see if people believe I grew up in China or not!
