This video shows the top 10 games searched everywhere in the world since 2004. I apologize if there are any mistakes, the video took a crap top of time and a like is greatly appreciated. Thanks.<br /><br />Note: Its not the search terms which are taken into account, the entire searches for a game are taken into account. Suppose COD, Call of duty both go together. The searches are found by using data from multiple sites and they might be a little off form actual values.<br /><br /><br />Music: Kevin Macleod
