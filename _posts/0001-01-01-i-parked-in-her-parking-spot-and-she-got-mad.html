I make mistakes, but sometimes it's hard to keep your cool when people make you feel like you don't belong. In this video, I parked in a residential parking spot in Malibu by mistake and the owner was NOT happy. She wouldn't let me leave until I proved that I had a friend that lived there.<br /><br />--------------<br />Thanks for checking out my channel and following my journey of sobriety; new videos are uploaded 2-4 times a week.
