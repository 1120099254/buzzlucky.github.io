Album No. 4 includes some singles of Paul McCartney going from1987 to 1990. Good Listening. <br /><br />Song facts<br />“Loveliest Thing” is love song written by McCartney, recorded in 1986, and finally released in 1989 as the B-Side of the “Figure Of Eight” CD single.<br /><br />While promoting “Press To Play”  in New York City in August 1986, Paul went into the studio with producer Phil Ramone (who previously worked with Paul the previous year on the “Spies Like Us” single). Phil Ramone was at this time producing Billy Joel ; and as a result, Billy Joel’s band played on the two songs worked on during those sessions – “Beautiful Night” and “Loveliest Thing“.<br /><br />Beyond those initial sessions, there are conflicting views on how “Loveliest Thing” took its final form for its 1989 release:<br /><br />On the “Pizza &amp; Fairytales” bootleg by Vigotone, the liner notes mention some overdubs being done in June 1987 (still with Phil Ramone).<br />On the book “Paul McCartney – Recording sessions (1969-2013)” by Luca Perasi, overdubs sessions are placed in June-July 1988 (at Hog Hill Studio)<br />Finally, on “Flowers In The Dirt” re-released in 2017, no overdubs are mentioned ; with final mix placed in August 1986, following a day of recording.<br /><br /><br />CREDITS<br />Producer: Phil Ramone <br />Engineers: Steve Rinkoff, Dave O'Donnell <br />Musicians: Paul McCartney: Lead Vocal, Pinao Neil Jason: Bass David Brown: Guitar. <br /><br />Paul recorded this song in New York with members of Billy Joel's band and Phil Ramone producing (21-29 August, 1986). The song was released on a special 2-CD edition of &quot;Flowers In The Dirt&quot; 1993 remastered edition) which was issued in Japan. <br />Very lovely and nice song, good listening. <br /><br />_____________________________ <br />Lyrics to song &quot;The Loveliest Thing&quot; <br />_____________________________ <br /><br /><br />ONE, TWO, WOW... <br /><br />TO ME YOU ARE THE LOVELIEST THING I'VE SEEN ALL DAY,<br />YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY,<br />NO, YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY.<br /><br />ALL MY LIFE I WONDERED WHY IT COULDN'T BE THIS WAY,<br />THAT WAS UP UNTIL TODAY,<br />OH, IT HAD TO BE THIS WAY.<br /><br />TODAY, WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING COMES<br />BEFORE YOU SLIP AWAY,<br />WITHOUT PERMISSION,<br />WITHOUT SUSPICION,<br />WITHOUT PERMISSION GIVEN.<br /><br />YOU SEEM TO HAVE A FRIENDLIER SMILE THAN ALL THE REST,<br />WELL, I LOOKED AND YOU WERE BEST,<br />YEAH, I'VE LOOKED AT ALL THE REST.<br /><br />YOU CAN'T IMAGINE PASSIONATE WORDS THAT I WOULD SAY,<br />IF ONLY YOU WOULD STAY,<br />OH, YOU KNOW YOU GOTTA STAY.<br /><br />TODAY, WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING COMES<br />BEFORE YOU SLIP AWAY,<br />WITHOUT PERMISSION,<br />WITHOUT SUSPICION,<br />WITHOUT PERMISSION GIVEN.<br /><br />YOU USED TO BE AN EARLY BIRD BUT HOW WAS I TO KNOW<br />YOU WOULD LEAVE WITHOUT SHEDDING A TEAR?<br />I ONLY WANNA LOVE YOU, I MAKE A WISH AND SUDDENLY<br />I'M GLAD THAT I HAVE YOU HERE,<br />OH, I'M GLAD I HAVE YOU HERE,<br />UH, TODAY, UH, UH.<br /><br />MM, UH -<br /><br />TO ME YOU ARE THE LOVELIEST THING I'VE SEEN ALL DAY,<br />AND YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY,<br />NO, YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT AWAY.<br /><br />BUT ALL MY LIFE I WONDERED WHY IT COULDN'T BE THIS WAY,<br />THAT WAS UP UNTIL TODAY,<br />YEAH, IT HAD TO BE THIS WAY.<br /><br />TODAY, WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING COMES<br />BEFORE YOU SLIP AWAY,<br />TODAY, OH, OH, OH, OH,<br />BEFORE YOU SLIP AWAY,<br />WITHOUT PERMISSION,<br />ABOVE SUSPICION,<br />WITHOUT PERMISSION GIVEN TO YOU.<br />AH, AH-AH, AH-AH,<br /><br />MM-MM.
