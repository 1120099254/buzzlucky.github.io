American logging in Idaho.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Panning shot of large number of large logs piled up and floating in water.  Logs are pushed from the piles into the river.  They float downstream.  A group of male workers move logs into place with special tools.  Men stand knee deep in the river.  One worker stands on a log and moves two others whilst they are all moving along the river.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Logs come down a wooden chute filled with water into the river.  &quot;Rumour has it that boisterous spirits have been known to travel down on the lots... but not the same man twice!&quot;  Logs are propelled down the chute, they fly off and into the water at the bottom.  Various shots of logs floating in the river.  <br /> FILM ID:870.08<br /><br />A VIDEO FROM BRITISH PATHÉ. EXPLORE OUR ONLINE CHANNEL, BRITISH PATHÉ TV.
