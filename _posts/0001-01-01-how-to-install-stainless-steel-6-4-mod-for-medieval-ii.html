Another How To video is here to for you guys. I got a few requests to do a video on how to install the Stainless Steel 6.4. I hope you find it informative. Keep in mind that it does need the 6.3 to build off of, but I cover all of that in the video. Please leave a like if it was helpful, and comment below if you have any issues. I will try to help you in any way I can. Enjoy and I will see you in the next one!
