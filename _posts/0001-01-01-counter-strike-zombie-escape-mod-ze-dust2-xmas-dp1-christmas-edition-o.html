Will santa bring you presents this year? It all depends on whether you can or can't make it! Survive the zombie infection to ensure your gift of 2020.<br /><br />Dust2 XMAS plays a little different from the original ze_dust2 since it changed directions and obstacles to offer a minimum of variety between the two versions. The biggest pro's of the map are that its long and offers many interesting choke points, allowing zombies to catch up most of the time, and that it's in a christmas setting for this time of the year. Its biggest letdown, however, is the ending. This ending might as well just have been a cutscene, since there's absolutely no way zombies can make it inside unless there are only a handful of humans left (and even then, it depends on how many have VIP-weaponry).<br /><br />A really fun map, and great to play around November and December months!<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />GAMEPLAY MODE: Zombie Escape<br /><br />Zombie Escape is a Source Mod that runs in CS, CS:S and CS:GO. The goal is to escape as a team (CT's) from the infected (T) that get randomly chosen each round. During the escaping attempt, random and fixed events may happen that reward special items to aid in pushing back the zombies. If the team succeeds in surviving, they win and the zombies are slayed.<br /><br />If the opposite is true, all humans will become infected and all hope is lost! Make sure to bring good teamwork to the table as you'll need it to overcome some of the harder challenges such as boss battles and giant zombie hordes.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />My Computer:<br /><br />- Operating System: Windows 10 Home 64-bit<br />- CPU: Intel Core i7 7820X @ 3.60GHz<br />- RAM: G.Skill Trident Z RGB 32,0GB Quad-Channel DDR4 (CL 14-14-14-34)<br />- Motherboard: Gigabyte Technology Co.
