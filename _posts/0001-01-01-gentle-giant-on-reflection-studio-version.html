The lyrics:<br /><br />In my way did I use you, do you think I really abused you<br />On reflection now it doesn't matter:<br />How can you say I made you need me more than anyone else<br />Who can say it right now it's finished over:<br />It's my act, it's my calling, I explained exactly the falling<br />Different ways of life can never even:<br />Be the same when you saw me, could you always take me the<br />same way As I came and went I tried to remember you:<br />Still you stay<br />Tied in your way<br />Changing times<br />Watching the signs<br /><br />How:<br />Could you see in me what you thought about all you want me to be<br />Now:<br />On reflection why should have I changed my ways for you<br />All around all around<br /><br />Cry my sympathy's with you but I never lied to you all in all<br />it seems it's just an experience:<br />Placed my cards on the table told of everything I was able,<br /><br />Understanding still not anything different:<br />Find another to lean on, start again for I should have long<br />gone, on reflection now it's just an experience.<br />Soon the pain will have ended, together never intended, as I<br />come and go I'll try to remember you.<br />Still you stay<br />Tied in your way<br />Changing times<br />Watching the signs<br />How:<br />All around all around...<br /><br />I'll remember the good things how can you forget all the years<br />that we shared in our way:<br />Things were changing my life, taking your place in my life and<br />our time drifting away:<br /><br />Look back it's not your game, together just in name.<br /><br />I'll remember the good things how can you forget all the years<br />that we shared in our way:<br />Things were changing my life, taking your place in my life and<br />our time drifting away:<br /><br />All around all around...<br /><br />Sheet music files of this song: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/File:On-reflection-ghasnes.zip">http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/File:On-reflection-ghasnes.zip</a> (Geir Hasnes)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/File:On-reflection-psmith.zip">http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/File:On-reflection-psmith.zip</a> (Phil Smith)<br /><br />Gentle Giant's home page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Gentle_Giant_Home_Page">http://www.blazemonger.com/GG/Gentle_Giant_Home_Page</a>
