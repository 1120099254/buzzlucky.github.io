There was a beautiful chord progression at the end of the episode that inspired him to create the beginning cello hook that starts Rain. From there, we wrote the melodies that bring the song to life. The chorus melody was actually written a while before Zack wrote the hook for Rain, but we felt that it fit the song perfectly once we began writing it. We named it Rain because the beginning cello hook that Zack plays reminded us of rain drops. Since we're from Arizona, rain has a special place in our hearts because it doesnâ€™t rain a lot here.<br /><br />This song has quickly become one of our most popular songs; it is now our third most viewed video in less than a year!
