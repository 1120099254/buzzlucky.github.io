Here’s a list of the most effective ways for searching Google to help you find anything in just a couple of clicks. Try these 15 simple methods to search Google for the information!<br /><br />Either this or that 1:07<br />Searching using synonyms 1:57<br />Searching within websites 2:40<br />The power of the asterisk 3:21<br />When lots of words are missing 3:55<br />Using a number range 4:38<br />Searching for a title or URL 5:22<br />Finding similar websites 5:44<br />Whole phrases 6:11<br />Unimportant search words 6:58<br />Searching for images using images 7:17<br />Defining words and learning where they come from 7:51<br />Finding a specific file 8:35<br />Using Google as a spell checker 9:06<br />Tracking your packages 9:33<br />Bonus trick 10:00<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />Google search is not only a powerful search tool but also the best friend for millions of people. It is always there for you (except for those times when you have no Internet connection – scary), and can help you with anything. <br />It will find the lyrics to that song you heard on the radio but only got “you, me, forever, rain,” share the recipe for the most delicious pie and recommend the best restaurant around. Students can’t go without it, and it is the key source of information for most adults, too. <br />- Simply put in a couple of potential variations of what you’re looking for, and separate them by typing the “|” symbol. Instead of this symbol, you can also use “or.”<br />- If you need to find websites on a given subject rather than those that include a specific phrase, add the “~” symbol to your search.<br />- Sometimes you read an interesting article on a website and find yourself subsequently wanting to share it with your friends or simply reread it. The easiest way to find the desired piece of information again is to search within the website. To do this, type the address of the site, then a keyword or entire phrase from the article, and it should come up immediately. <br />- When your cunning memory decides not to let us remember that one keyword, phrase, or number we need to find what we’re looking for, you can turn to the powerful &quot;*&quot; symbol. Just use it in the place of the word/phrase you can’t remember, and you should be able to find the results you’re looking for. <br />- If it’s the lengthier half of the phrase you can’t remember rather than a single keyword, try writing out the first and last words and putting “AROUND + (the approximate number of missing words)“ between them. <br />- If we want to find out about scientific discoveries during the 20th century, we can write: scientific discoveries 1900…2000. Yes, it is easy like that. It also works with other numbers. <br /><br />BONUS<br />You did some hard work learning to use Google like a pro, so now it’s time to play. If you search Atari Breakout on Google Images, the famous brick breaker will start right there.
