This series teaches us what the purposes of the church are - to worship, belong, grow, serve, and share!<br /><br />Our hope is that the kids would understand that church is a safe, fun place for them to be a part of Godâ€™s family. We want them to see how each of the purposes plays out in the course of a weekend service.
