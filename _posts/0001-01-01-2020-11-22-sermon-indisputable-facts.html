Pastor Elder Howard W. Smith, Sr.<br /><br />May God Bless You Dear Ones,<br /><br />And a good evening/morning to each of you. &quot;In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.&quot; I Thessalonians 5:18<br /><br />We pray that all is well with each of you and that your aim in this life, is to live godly in Christ Jesus, here on earth that you will be with the Lord in His Kingdom, one day, after all is said and done. When??? Only the God of all flesh knows. Amen??? Amen.<br /><br />Today, the Lord brought to our attention, the importance of knowing &quot;facts&quot;, &quot;Indisputable Facts&quot;, ones that regardless of how difficult it may seem, that they are not, and yet they are, because if it is written, it has already been proven to be certain. How are we doing Church???<br /><br />Listen Dear Ones, one of the most important fact about God is, that He is and that He is a rewarder to them that diligently seek Him.  There is none other, besides Him; He is the Judge of both heaven and earth; in Him we live and have our state of being, and without him we are nothing. That Dear Ones, is an &quot;Indisputable Fact&quot;. Amen??? Amen.<br /><br />Throughout the Sermon, many &quot;Indisputable Facts&quot; were laid out; one in particular is that in the very beginning, God made &quot;them&quot; to be a male and a female. And that's an &quot;Indisputable Fact&quot; Also, marriage between one man and one woman is, (according to Him), honorable. Not man and man, nor woman and woman: but marriage between a man and a woman, for through that union, He seeks a godly seed, and there can be no godly seed or any seen for that matter,  coming forth from a same sex get together. And that is also an, &quot;Indisputable Fact.&quot; Can I get an Amen Sister??? What about you Brother, Can I get An Amen from you as well??? Thank You!!!<br /><br />Now take a breath, and digest this one, &quot;Wine (God says in Proverbs 20:1) is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.&quot; &quot;Indisputable Facts&quot; For I will ask you this question: when have you ever seen a wise drunk man, woman, boy or girl??? Not ever!!! Is there a witness??? Tell the truth and shame the devil!!!<br /><br />Love to you all, keep Brother Garnett E. Kirby, Jr in your prayers, his hip surgery went well, but the aftermath of it all is hitting him really hard. So we pray for grace that will enable him to endure this hardness as a good patient. The better days are ahead, if he can just endure by the grace of God, the pain for now. For no pain, no gain, is what folks say today. Amen??? Amen.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />The Pastor
