This video talks about the importance an why we should continue to learn no matter how old we are,<br /><br />&amp; it doesn't mean we only learn while we are at school, I'm meaning we can learn anything and everything, whether it be by listening, engaging, reading or watching.<br /><br />Learning is for everyone an I believe that learning can be one of the biggest investments in our life, as the more we learn the greater our abilities and the greater the opportunities.<br /><br />Try to learning something new everyday whether it be big or small, if you cannot fit that in try learning something new once a week.<br /><br />So no matter what, I really want to inspire everyone to continue to learn an be the best that they can be.<br /><br />If you would like to share something you have learnt that is important to you please leave it in the comments below.<br /><br />The song played in the beginning and end is &quot;Mama&quot; by Jonas Blue Featuring William Singe
