Psa 35:27  Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.<br />Wanted to do some vertical tillage but it blew up!  Ended up working with cousin on a portion of his Gleaner combine project but all in all it was a great day, a really great day. ðŸ˜Š
