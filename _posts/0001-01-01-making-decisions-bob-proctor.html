Bob Proctor stresses the importance Decision-Making has on your life and how to make decisions promptly. Click here for free download to help you with Making Decisions!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2MXym3F">http://bit.ly/2MXym3F</a><br /><br />Napoleon Hill in Think and Grow Rich wrote an entire chapter on Decision. Most people never make decisions. They have a difficult time with it. Why is that? I think they have a difficult time because their parents made decisions for them until they were too old. And they never learned how to make them. <br /><br />The one thing that I did with my kids I never made a decision for them. They didn't like it. They'd say come one don't do that to me, and I said no what do you think you should do? And I'd leave it at that. Decision-making is a phenomenal concept. <br /><br />And you're gonna find out as he points out in here that successful people make decisions very fast, and they change them very slow if and when they change them at all. He said that people who'd have difficulty in life make their decisions very slow and then change them fast and often. And decision-making is a funny thing. <br /><br />You and I think on frequencies. If we could see a bunch of lines and we're thinking on a frequency, and we are on this frequency here and we say I'm gonna do that when this changes. This is never gonna change until you get up on this frequency. <br /><br />See the good thing you are after is on a higher frequency than you are operating on. A greater awareness. And if you're down here and you're thinking here on this frequency, and the good you wanna up here, you got to get your mind up there. How do you get up there? Make the decision and be there. And that's really what you have to do. <br /><br />The second you make a decision, you flip your brain on to a different frequency and you start to attract things to you that you'd never get without making the decision. We do a lot of work in decision-making in our seminars. It is the most valuable part of the seminar. People wanna overcome procrastination make decisions. <br /><br />And if you really wanna make it happen, get this book Think and Grow Rich and read the chapter on decision every day for 30 days. I guarantee you, you'll be a different person when you finish it. <br /><br />Now click on the link here and leave your information and get into this subject!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2MXym3F">http://bit.ly/2MXym3F</a><br /><br />Make decisions, very fast.<br /><br /><br />**For more visit our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/kYTfZp">http://goo.gl/kYTfZp</a> **<br /><br /><br />Subscribe for more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/VL0Smo">http://goo.gl/VL0Smo</a><br /><br />Check out our most popular video series!<br />1.
