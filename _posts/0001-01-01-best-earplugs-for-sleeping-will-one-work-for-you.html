They block everyday sounds, such as a loud neighbor or a snoring partner, so you don't wake up needlessly in the middle of the night. <br /><br />We've put together the 4 BEST earplugs for sleeping. They're all different materials and types and come in a range of functions and prices.<br /><br />We've also put together a list of things to think about before you hand over any cash for your next pair of earplugs. Sweet dreams!<br /><br />0:45 - Bose Noise-Masking Sleepbuds - These high-quality earplugs are really a hybrid of an earplug and a headphone. They wirelessly sync to an app on your mobile device and stream ambient sounds from a preloaded library. They also have their own alarm, so you can wake up (and hit snooze) as many times as you want without waking anyone else up. They're pricey though, coming in at $250 for a pair.<br /><br />--------<br /><br />1:28 - Mack's Slim Fit Foam Earplugs - These simple foam earplugs are a great fit for smaller ear canals or those with sensitive ears. The smaller fit means the plug has a small diameter, so it's less likely to rub against your ear and you won't have to stuff the plug in your ear to make it fit, only to feel it pop out at night. They're super affordable at 50 pairs for just $10.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />2:35 - Ohropax Classic Wax Earplugs - These German-made wax earplugs are super customizable. Simply pull away the cotton cover with clean hands and use as much of the wax ball as you want to seal your ear. The wax warms up quickly in your hand and is super mold-able. You can get 6 pairs for just $6.<br /><br />--------<br /><br />3:36 - PQ Sleep Reusable Earplugs - PQ Sleep's reusable earplugs are three-tiered silicone earplugs that fit nicely into your ear and can be worn for multiple nights. They should work for all sleep positions. <br /><br /><br />To catch our latest Mattress Clarity videos, make sure to subscribe! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQCQQ6wQlaKtIcxKG3tZFTw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQCQQ6wQlaKtIcxKG3tZFTw?sub_confirmation=1</a>  <br /><br />And in the meantime, check out some of our all-time most popular videos:<br /><br />Best Mattress Picks: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8kzd5Djl78">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8kzd5Djl78</a><br /><br />Best Mattresses for Side Sleepers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4iQc8nicfE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4iQc8nicfE</a><br /><br />Nectar Mattress Review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWeI0botY7M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWeI0botY7M</a><br /><br />Best Memory Foam Mattress: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_ZWke0Nu60">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_ZWke0Nu60</a>
