With all the swell we've had lately, Bali's West coast hasn't exactly been front of mind. But there was enough of a drop in size to warrant a trip to Canggu yesterday, and even though there were a few over sized wobblers, the small to medium sets had plenty of shape and the odd tube section.<br /><br />The wind was playing nice, and by the time we left at around 11am conditions were still fairly clean.<br /><br />The forecast is for a further drop in size, so we'll probably head back to this part of the coast tomorrow. After that, it looks like the Bukit will be throwing up some more overhead goodness.<br /><br />Subscribe to this channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Tu1Poz">https://bit.ly/2Tu1Poz</a><br /><br />You can also follow us here:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/surfersof">https://www.facebook.com/surfersof</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/surfersofbali">https://www.instagram.com/surfersofbali</a><br /><br />#SurfersOfBali #July2019Bali #SurfingBali #Canggu
