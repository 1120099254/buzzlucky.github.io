Brain stimulation therapies are important and effective treatments for people with depression and other mental disorders. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is supporting studies exploring how to make brain stimulation therapies more personalized and effective while reducing side effects.<br /> <br />Dr. Sarah Lisanby, Director of the NIMH Noninvasive Neuromodulation Unit, and Dr. Matthew Rudorfer, Associate Director of the NIMH Treatment Research Division of Services and Intervention Research, describe transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Through these and many other research projects, NIMH is striving to bring hope, therapies, and treatments to individuals and families affected by mental disorders. <br /> <br />For more information, visit www.nimh.nih.gov/braintherapies.
