How to make a cheap DIY giant dry erase whiteboard for under $35!<br /><br />Hello Everyone!<br /><br />I feel like I have just been throwing a bunch of DIY videos towards you guys lately! As mentioned in my previous video, we just moved from our temporary apartment to a house in Austin and have been busy trying to settle into our new home. <br /><br />I am so excited because for the first time... EVER... I have my very own office space and have been trying to figure out how to set it up. A must-have for me in this new space is a place where I can write down everything I need to do and any ideas that I might have thought up during the day. I have a blank wall behind my desk that would be the perfect space for a giant whiteboard! Unfortunately, I didn't realize how expensive giant dry erase boards are so I did my research and found this ingenious hack to make a massive 4' x 8' white board using white panel board from the hardware store for less than $35!<br /><br />The Board I Bought: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thd.co/2NGXbDj">https://thd.co/2NGXbDj</a><br />*If you don't have a truck or a way of transporting the board, you might be able to get the store to deliver it to you.<br /><br />As I mentioned in my video, I did not come up with this DIY but got that idea after researching the topic and was inspired by other youtube videos. Here are some of the videos I watched before trying this out for myself:<br /><br />• The original video I got the giant whiteboard idea from (September 7, 2009): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EgqrQqhghw4">https://youtu.be/EgqrQqhghw4</a> <br />• Another really great video (January 16, 2016): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/gqdaF_rk6-Y">https://youtu.be/gqdaF_rk6-Y</a><br />• Using mirror mount &amp; plastic bracket trims (January 26, 2017): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/8r6Lm1y_diY">https://youtu.be/8r6Lm1y_diY</a><br /><br />There are a lot of people who have posted videos of this tutorial in the past, just to cover my bases, I went out and tried to find as many of these videos as I can to link to so that I am not accused of stealing the &quot;original&quot; video. I do not know who the very first person who came up with this video is but I am definitely not claiming to be the first:<br />• sayhijames (December 15, 2009)- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/GhRE0Ct9HEc">https://youtu.be/GhRE0Ct9HEc</a><br />• Jay Bates - Woodworking Videos (Oct 20, 2013)- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/W5sdl0Hqs4Q">https://youtu.be/W5sdl0Hqs4Q</a><br />• Dustin Kantu (March 15, 2013)- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/gv8HEmc0_PU">https://youtu.be/gv8HEmc0_PU</a><br />• Andrew V (January 17, 2017)- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/PEznnMSDT7M">https://youtu.be/PEznnMSDT7M</a><br />• Cecil Marche TV (August 17, 2014)- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Rv8bqWb_qc4">https://youtu.be/Rv8bqWb_qc4</a><br /><br />Watch this video to see how I made my own custom whiteboard!<br /><br />Also, if you have a whiteboard or dry erase board that is losing its smoothness, check out <br />How I Renew My Whiteboards for a Smoother Surface: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/un92k6Q7X6A">https://youtu.be/un92k6Q7X6A</a><br /><br />I hope you enjoyed this video! <br /><br />Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions in the ✍🏼 C O M M E N T ✍🏼 section below.<br /><br />It would mean the world to me if you could hit that 👍🏼 L I K E 👍🏼 button if you enjoyed this video. <br /><br />Also, please 🚩📝 S U B S C R I B E 📝🚩 to my channel so you don't miss out on future videos! <br /><br />Thanks so much for watching!
