Hiyaaaaa<br /><br />Right then lads, I am finally getting my hands on the F80 M3! And with the help of the guys down at AutoID she is looking better than ever. I love the way the carbon off sets the speed yellow, it just needs a few little performance tweaks now and she is almost perfect.. <br /><br />A big thank you to the guys down at AUTOID for all of their help and advice. <br /><br />Make sure that you check them out:<br />@autoid on instagram <br />www.autoid.co<br /><br /><br />See you all next week <br />B xx<br /><br /><br />Follow me on Instagram:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/queenb">https://www.instagram.com/queenb</a><br /><br /><br />TURTLE WAX PRODUCTS USED:<br />www.turtlewax.com/en-gb/our-products/hybrid-solutions/turtle-wax-hybrid-solutions-ceramic-3-in-1-detailer/<br /><br />---<br /><br />Music:<br />CAUTION - SKRXLLA
