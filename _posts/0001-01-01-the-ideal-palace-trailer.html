Based on the incredible true story of Joseph Ferdinand Cheval, The Ideal Palace is the tale of Cheval (Jacques Gamblin), a simple postman who travels every day along the Dr√¥me, from village to village. Alone, and upset he meets the woman of his life, Philomena (Laetitia Casta). From their union- their daughter Alice is born. For this child he loves more than anything, Cheval throws himself into a crazy gamble: to build her, with his own hands, an incredible palace. Never spared by the ordeals of life, this ordinary man will not give up and will devote 33 years to build an extraordinary work: &quot;The Ideal Palace&quot;`
