This world of warships Acasta guide contains all my own personal hms Acasta gameplay highlights including wows acasta modules, full world of warships acasta build with captain skills including my own thoughts and strategy on how to play the hms Acasta in world of warships.<br /><br />Hms Acasta holds a unique place in history being involved in the first loss of a british aircraft carrier in combat. In June 1940 Ardent and Acasta were escorting Hms Glorious back to Scapa Flow on 8 June. En route, the three ships were spotted by Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at 15:46, which changed course to investigate. They were not spotted by the British until shortly after 16:00 and Ardent was ordered to identify the German ships while the other ships remained on course. She turned back to rejoin them before the Germans opened fire at 16:27 and was engaged by the 15-centimetre (5.9 in) secondary armament, mostly by Scharnhorst, while both ships fired at Glorious with their main batteries. Acasta remained with the carrier and began making smoke after the Germans opened fire, even opening fire herself although her guns lacked the range to reach the battleships. The destroyer was struck not long after she began laying smoke, but it had little effect. After the carrier was hit multiple times and starting to list, Acasta left her and closed with the battleships to shorten the range for a torpedo attack. Now more visible to the battleships, she began to be hit more regularly. The first attack was unsuccessful, but one torpedo from the second attack blew a massive 12meter gash in Scharnhorst's hull at 17:34. Acasta was then reduced to a blazing wreck and her captain ordered her crew to abandon ship. One of the gun crews delayed long enough to fire a shot that struck one of the Scharnhorst's main guns, but inflicted nothing more than shrapnel damage. The destroyer sank stern first around 18:20. Most of her crew died from exposure before the Norwegian merchant ship SS Borgund rescued two survivors from Acasta three days later, along with 36 men from Glorious.<br />acasta world of warships, acasta wows, hms acasta wows, wows acasta review, how to play hms acasta, acasta destroyer, wows acasta, wows hms acasta, hms acasta world of warships, wows acasta captain skills, acasta captain build, wows acasta tier 5,british destroyer acasta, wows acasta build, wows acasta modules, world of warships acasta review, world of warships acasta build, world of warships acasta, wows acasta review, wows.<br /><br />Acasta is unique among her peers due to her lack of the Engine Boost in exchange for super acceleration. This makes it much easier to quickly react to and evade slow incoming torpedoes that have been detected at proximity detection distance. However, this is only possible if the ship is already in forward motion or stationary, as the acceleration from reversing to forwards is, much like the cruisers of the same nation, painfully slow. Another attribute which Acasta also lacks is a buffer range for using torpedoes; that is, her maximum possible concealment is the same as her torpedo effective range (6.0km). Players will have to utilize the enemy ships' path and forward momentum to stay hidden while launching their torpedoes undetected. And the power of Acasta’s ability to single-fire torpedoes thus comes into play; any enemy ship heading straight in a line can and will be struck by the salvo of all eight of her torpedoes, which generally results in a devastating strike.<br /><br />While Acasta at a first glance seems as one of the weakest destroyers of tier V, her acceleration, concealment, and ability to single-fire torpedoes are her other strengths that players can utilize, although it is difficult to do so. She requires a different mindset and approach to use effectively. And above all else, players should avoid Podvoisky as much as possible, as Podvoisky can be considered her worst enemy due to the speed difference.<br />Extra care should also be taken engaging destroyers at higher tiers due to the concealment disadvantage.<br />I had a lot of fun playing HMS Acasta and it's a tough little ship capable of outperforming all expectations. I hope you enjoy the video and let me know in the comments what you think.<br /><br /><br />#hmsacasta<br />#howtoplaywows<br />#howtoplayworldofwarships
