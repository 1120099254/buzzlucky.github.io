Spyro the Dragon Remastered Trilogy | FALCON Evidence and Twitter Handle Ownership<br /><br />I don't even know what the title of this video should be. It could be super clickbaity but I really wanted to put the &quot;FALCON&quot; thing in the title. Because that's the crux of this discovery. That's the flat out incredible connection made by JumpButton.<br /><br />This is the final piece of the puzzle before the enevitable announcement. I'm 100% on board that we're getting an announcement very soon. The Kotaku leak has to be real, with all this in mind. The video is all over the place because there's a lot to digest.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier that the game has been a thing since as early as 2016. Spyro deserves that.<br /><br />UPDATE: The FALCON listing is actually from 2017, but this doesn't actually dispute the development times for the most part. They probably started in 2016.<br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/JumpButtonCB/">https://twitter.com/JumpButtonCB/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SpyroTheDragon">https://twitter.com/SpyroTheDragon</a><br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />// CrystalFissure Social Media //<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/crystalfissure">https://soundcloud.com/crystalfissure</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://crystalfissure.bandcamp.com">https://crystalfissure.bandcamp.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/crystalfissure">https://twitter.com/crystalfissure</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/crystalfissure">https://instagram.com/crystalfissure</a>
