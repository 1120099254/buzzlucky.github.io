After over eight long months of thinking I was almost finished, I finally completed and released my first full animation. It's also my birthday! :D<br /><br /> I wish I had kept track of exactly when I first started this project. I checked the &quot;Date Created&quot; of my first session, but it said it was created in August, which is absurd. <br /> Although I am extremely proud of &quot;most&quot; of this animation, I don't think I will do many other full length animations any time soon. This project was exhausting to work on. Sometimes I would feel extra motivated, and other times it would be the last thing I wanted to do. Even though I was so inconsistent when working on it, it was still stressing me out.<br /><br />(Continued description in comments)<br /><br />Discord Server and Deviantart can be found in my about page.<br /><br />CREDITS!<br /><br />Fnaf by: Scott Cawthon<br /><br />Song by: The Great Dolvondo<br /><br />Fonts used;<br /><br />Inlanders<br />DeathBlood<br /><br />Programs used;<br /><br />Source Filmmaker <br />Adobe Premiere Pro<br />Adobe Photoshop <br /><br />Maps used;<br /><br />Fnaf1 map: Salamance, Robgamings, AustinTheBear<br />Fnaf2 map: TF541Productions, Robgamings, AustinTheBear, BonBun Films, Salamance, Ruthoranium<br />Fnaf3 map: TF541Productions, Robgamings, AustinTheBear, Salamance, uJidow, GamesProduction, ChuizaProductions, SuperArtherBros, FrozTy, MrOkidoki97<br />Sister Location map: Textures: TF541Produtions, Robgamings, SAB, The 64th Gamer, WeaselWare, Scott Cawthon.
