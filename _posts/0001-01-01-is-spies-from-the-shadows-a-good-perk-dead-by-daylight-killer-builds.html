Testing out the perk Spies from the Shadows, to see if it's a viable tracking perk. In particular, testing out to see if it's better than Whispers which is my go-to perk for tracking. I'm using my regular huntress build but simply replacing a perk for Spies, and then giving my overall thoughts about it. <br /><br />Thumbnail render made by Niina!
