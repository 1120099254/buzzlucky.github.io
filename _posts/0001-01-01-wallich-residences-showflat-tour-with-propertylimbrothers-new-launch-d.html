After 3 years in the service, they decided to start out their career in real estate together. Since then, Melvin Lim &amp; Adrian Lim has transacted more than 1400 properties and successfully helped many families with their real estate needs and investment properties.<br /><br />After 10 years in the industry, in year 2016, they found that the way properties is marketed in Singapore is really boring, because everyone was just taking photos of the properties with their phones and uploading it to property portals. Which Melvin calls it a ‚Äúwait and see approach‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt becomes a very passive form of marketing because we have to wait for buyers to find us, and we don't have any content to reach and to attract the right audience &amp; buyers‚Äù, (Melvin). <br /><br />They then became the first in Singapore to create Home Presentation Tours with a human factor in the video and weaving plus points, features, benefits and importantly, telling a story for each property thus creating a niche in helping their sellers‚Äô properties differentiate &amp; stand out by marketing their property listings with a creative approach. Currently PropertyLimBrothers has close to 500 videos represented.<br /><br />Producing their signature home tour videos with unique content became their daily bread. All content are created in house, because they do not wish to outsource this creative portion, thus giving rise to forming their own social media in-house agency team (PropertyLimBrothersMedia). <br /><br />This tagline #RealEstateWithIntegrity stays at the centre of the entire team, because Melvin and Adrian has a core belief that only in glorifying God in their work and business, then brings true meaning to work. Jesus says to #LoveYourNeighbour as thy self and this commandment is to be lived out in the marketplace thus excellence and integrity is naturally at its core in the way we treat people with love, integrity and care.<br /><br />Melvin Lim is CEO and co-founder of PropertyLimBrothers (PLB Team) - a real estate team in Singapore that serves her clientele and projects with unique crafted content and marketing and advertising campaign. Also the founder of PropertyLimBrothers Media Pte Ltd, a solely owned social media and studio production house that crafts each project that PropertyLimBrothers Team undertakes. Its an agency that Melvin set up in order to serve PLB‚Äôs clients with a different experience.
