Hey everyone! I know I said I was going to post a video this week about my experience on American Idol, but I recorded it, and it ended up being wayyy too long, so I decided to upload a song for you all instead! I hope you enjoy! Also, this is short notice, but if you live in Michigan and you don't have any plans tomorrow, COME MEET ME! I'll be singing near Birch Run! The link to the event is below! Thank you all for your continued support! Have an amazing weekend! :)<br /><br />EVENT!<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.abc12.com/content/news/ABC12-invites-everyone-to-8th-annual-Family-Expo-on-Saturday-479420443.html">http://www.abc12.com/content/news/ABC12-invites-everyone-to-8th-annual-Family-Expo-on-Saturday-479420443.html</a><br /><br />Instagram: @singer4jesus<br />Snapchat: @genlink16<br />Facebook: @gennalaurenmusic<br />Twitter: @genlinkowski<br /><br />James 1:17 - Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like the shifting shadows. <br /><br />Tags: I can only imagine, I can only imagine movie, movie, mercy me, mercyme, bart Millard, the voice, American idol, Americas got talent, auditions, tour, Genavieve, Genavieve Linkowski, thrift store, viral, passion, dream, dreams, music, musician, musical, sing, singer, singers, singing, God, Jesus, Holy Spirit, equipment, microphone, Scarlett solo, piano, keyboard, camera, iPhone, social media, song, songs, cover, video, tv show, reality tv, abc, abc network, contestant, march 11, premier
