All In all I grew winter onions, summer onions, red onions, white onions, grew from sets grew from seed, grew in a raised bed, grew in buckets and grew in yogurt pots. Growing at home and pushed for space anything goes and when I have more onions than room my onion bed is 'rammed' and the over spill finishes up in buckets and pots.
