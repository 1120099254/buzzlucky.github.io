Without them you lack focus and direction. They also provide you with a benchmark to determine whether or not you're actually succeeding at them.<br />We all struggle sometimes to achieve our plans. And it's not that we lack the effort, but our goals are not structured efficiently.<br />To accomplish your objective you need to know how to set it up properly. You can't simply say, &quot;I wish I could make more money&quot; and expect it to happen.<br />A goal without a plan is just a wish.<br />It is also important to recognize, that not all objectives are created equal.<br />So, today I'll explain the SMART method of goal setting and how it will amplify your chances of actually succeeding.<br /><br />S stands for: Specific<br />Your goal must be clear and well defined. You can only get to where you want by defining precisely how you'll get there.<br /><br />M stands for: Measurable<br />Tracking the progress of your goal is an important part of keeping you motivated. It allows you to set milestones that you can celebrate when you achieve them and reevaluate when you donâ€™t.<br /><br />A stands for: Attainable<br />Make sure that it's possible to achieve the dreams you set for yourself. Far too many people fall into the trap of setting impossible goals. While they may push you forward for a while, you will almost certainly end up giving up on them. Instead of being impossible, your goals should be challenging yet achievable.<br /><br />R stands for: Relevant<br />Your plans should be relevant to the direction you want your life and career to take. A common issue we face, is having too many goals at the same time, or pursuing the wrong goals. Unless your plan is relevant to your overall life plan, achieving it may not accomplish anything.<br /><br />T stands for: Time bound<br />This is one of the most important factors.<br />You plans must have a deadline. If you don't set a time limit you have basically unlimited time to achieve your goals.<br /><br />But there's one last thing. Most people think that goal setting is a one time event. Like you set your goals once and you're done. However it's actually an ongoing process. It never ends.<br />Your plans will need evaluation and revision so it's important to stay flexible.<br /><br />Business email: Betterthanyesterday1337@gmail.com<br /><br />#smart #goals
