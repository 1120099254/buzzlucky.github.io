I love it!<br /><br />I performed customer support PERSONALLY for 2 years while building Clarity. <br /><br />Why? Because it’s an incredible opportunity for a founder to learn from your customers, guide product strategy and make sure your product is serving real people.<br /><br />Most CEOs and founders delegate their customer support as SOON as they can.<br /><br />I get it. You want to work on the high-level strategy.<br /><br />But... make a habit of scanning your support tickets.<br /><br />If you’re smart about interpreting those requests and tracing them back to find product insights or marketing hacks, you’ll scale faster.<br /><br />For my companies, I made sure Customer Support was one of our competitive advantages and we have since been recognized as having some of the best support in the industry.<br /><br />Want to know what we did? In this video, I’ll walk you through our strategies to turn Customer Support from a burden to a privilege.<br /><br />I’ll break it down into 5 key components behind my Customer Support growth-hacking strategy. Here we go:<br /><br />1. Customer Outcomes<br />2. Support Support (Yes, you read that right)<br />3. Flow Escalation<br />4. Measure the Metrics<br />5. Productize the Knowledge Base<br /><br />One thing I LOVE about Customer Support is that it’s your opportunity to set word-of-mouth marketing alight.<br /><br />No matter how many ads you are running or marketing funnels you’ve built, people trust the recommendations of other people most.<br /><br />Word-of-mouth marketing trumps all others.<br /><br />Having a kickass Customer Support system means active customers are getting incredible first-hand experiences from your team… and that translates into direct recommendations.<br /><br />Looking back at my experience across 5 companies, I’d say the 2 things that made our support world-class were:<br /><br />1. We documented and backfilled lessons learned from support, and put them into a growing knowledge base.<br />2. We used automation, snippets and text expanders to quickly use templatized answers to common customer issues.<br /><br />The result? Support demand dropped and so did response time.<br /><br />Tune in to the video right here to get a dose of Customer Support strategy that’ll turn dreaded tickets into welcome insights.<br /><br />Dan “ground control for startups” Martell<br /><br />Don't forget to share this entrepreneurial advice with your friends, so they can learn too: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/YGWwkdnEWvE">https://youtu.be/YGWwkdnEWvE</a><br /><br />Learn how to scale, grow and exit with Dan Martell and some of the top SaaS Founders in the business on the Escape Velocity show: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2vWF03N">http://bit.ly/2vWF03N</a><br /><br />=====================<br />ABOUT DAN MARTELL<br />=====================<br /><br />“You can only keep what you give away.” That’s the mantra that’s shaped Dan Martell from a struggling 20-something business owner in the Canadian Maritimes (which is waaay out east) to a successful startup founder who’s raised more than $3 million in venture funding and exited not one... not two... but three tech businesses: Clarity.fm, Spheric and Flowtown.<br /><br />You can only keep what you give away. That philosophy has led Dan to invest in 33+ early stage startups such as Udemy, Intercom, Unbounce and Foodspotting. It’s also helped him shape the future of Hootsuite as an advisor to the social media tour de force. <br /><br />An activator, a tech geek, an adrenaline addict and, yes, a romantic (ask his wife Renee), Dan has recently turned his attention to teaching startups a fundamental, little-discussed lesson that directly impacts their growth: how to scale. You’ll find not only incredible insights in every moment of every talk Dan gives - but also highly actionable takeaways that will propel your business forward. Because Dan gives freely of all that he knows. After all, you can only keep what you give away.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD: Customer Support Builder™ - Best Practices, Processes, and Flows to Build a World-Class Support Experience That's Less Time Consuming - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2AS9tWs">https://bit.ly/2AS9tWs</a>
