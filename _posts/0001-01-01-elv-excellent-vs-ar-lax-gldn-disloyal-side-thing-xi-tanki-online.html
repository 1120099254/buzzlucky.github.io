100,000 Views later,<br /><br />Thanks for another amazing year peeps! Can't believe I actually reached a milestone this massive, especially this year the channel has been growing rapidly and all I have to say is thank you!<br /><br />If it wasn't for Oto or Excellent as you may know him this wouldn't be made.<br />His channel link is right here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUEW8QzMZwwIMgXnYwQfimQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUEW8QzMZwwIMgXnYwQfimQ</a><br /><br />I appreciate everyone who helped me while playing or who kept me getting motivated to upload the videos. I know for a fact nobody will want to watch me playing through HMTL5 because it is not the same. I'll start streaming soon and probably move to something different. <br /><br />Anyways shout-out to: Linda, Leo, Oto, Handsome, Cesar, Elya, Arsy, Medz, Theo, Daniil, Damir, Raad, Deya, and many more.<br /><br />Whoever chatted shit for the past two months look what happened to you now LOL, Harmony gets 350 views in two weeks, Eli the side chick gets passed around by 5 different guys in one month. I still got dms where Wizardry was begging to buy him.
