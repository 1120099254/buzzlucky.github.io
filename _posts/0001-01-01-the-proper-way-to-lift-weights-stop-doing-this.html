Take my FREE QUIZ to find out what diet and training is perfect for you! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vshred.fit/myfitquizforyou">http://vshred.fit/myfitquizforyou</a><br /><br />Too many times, I hear people complaining about never actually gaining any muscle and never seeing significant results in the mirror. <br /><br />Then I ask them, &quot;Well, what does your diet and training look like?&quot; And when they tell me that they eat clean and workout 5 days a week, from the outside looking in, it sounds like they should be making progress.<br /><br />But then you get a little deeper into their diet and it's way off, and then if you watch one of their workouts, 99% of the time, they are not training at max intensity. They aren't pushing their limits. They aren't lifting until failure. They go into the gym, knowing what they're doing, but once they hit their pre-set number of reps, they call it quits. When, in reality, they could've done 2-3 more reps.. And those last 2-3 reps are the most important anyways! The end of your set should be all you could physically handle, while maintaining good form.<br /><br />Crack down on your diet, push yourself in your training and you WILL get results. Guaranteed.<br /><br />If you are interested in having my team of professionals and I write you a custom meal and/or training plan and straightening this out once and for all, check ours out! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vshred.fit/CustomizedPlan">http://vshred.fit/CustomizedPlan</a><br /><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Check out My Supplement Stacks! <br /><br />For Fat Loss : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vshred.fit/12FatLossStackYT">http://vshred.fit/12FatLossStackYT</a><br /><br />For Muscle Building : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vshred.fit/12MuscleStackYT">http://vshred.fit/12MuscleStackYT</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------
