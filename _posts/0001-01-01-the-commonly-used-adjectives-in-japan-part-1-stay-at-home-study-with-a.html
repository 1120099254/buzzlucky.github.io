This is Mei Akemi Ihara, a Japanese native.<br />Previously, we've studied some words about emotions and if you haven't watch it, please watch the video by clicking the link below.<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SmcUkE__75s">https://youtu.be/SmcUkE__75s</a><br />Anyways for today, we're going to learn the basic adjectives that Japanese love to use. We’ll also learn different tenses: present, present negative, past and past negative.<br />But before we could dig deeper, I have to explain something about subjects and honorific expressions in Japanese language. A trivia, did you know that we usually omit the subject “It”?<br />Let's take this English sentence&quot;It’s beautiful&quot; as an example. If you literally translate it in Japanese, it will become “sore wa kirei desu”. Yes, this is correct but we usually just say “Kirei” or &quot;Kirei desu”.<br />As for honorific expressions, we need to distinguish first who we are talking to. When talking to our family and friends, we can use common or informal expressions but when we talk to elders or when we're at the office, we speak politely.<br />So today, we will follow this order. I will say the English phrase first, the Japanese common expression then the Japanese honorific expression.
