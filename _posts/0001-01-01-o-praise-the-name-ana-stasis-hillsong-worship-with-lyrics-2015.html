O Praise The Name (Anástasis) -  Hillsong Worship 2015<br /><br />I cast my mind to Calvary<br />Where Jesus bled and died for me<br />I see His wounds, His hands, His feet<br />My Savior on that cursed tree<br /><br />His body bound and drenched in tears<br />They laid Him down in Joseph's tomb<br />The entrance sealed by heavy stone<br />Messiah still and all alone<br /><br />O praise the Name of the Lord our God<br />O praise His Name forevermore<br />For endless days we will sing Your praise<br />Oh Lord, Oh Lord our God<br /><br />And then on the third at break of dawn<br />The Son of Heaven rose again<br />O trampled death, where is your sting?<br />The angels roar for Christ the King<br /><br />O praise the Name of the Lord our God<br />O praise His Name forevermore<br />For endless days we will sing Your praise<br />Oh Lord, Oh Lord our God<br /><br />He shall return in robes of white<br />The blazing sun shall pierce the night<br />And I will rise among the saints<br />My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face<br /><br />O praise the Name of the Lord our God<br />O praise His Name forevermore<br />For endless days we will sing Your praise<br />Oh Lord, Oh Lord our God
