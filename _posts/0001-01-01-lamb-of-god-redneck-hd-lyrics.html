Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />So God damn easy to write this<br /><br /> you make it spill off the page<br /><br /> So drunk on yourself, self-righteous<br /><br /> A laughing stock of your own fucking stage<br /><br /><br /><br /> Oh but I ain't one to call names<br /><br /> Or throw stones in a house of glass<br /><br /> You try me<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is a motherfuckin' invitation<br /><br /> The only one you could ever need<br /><br /> This is a motherfuckin' invitation<br /><br /> You try me<br /><br /><br /><br /> Just one time you got a reason<br /><br /> Heard you had nothing to lose<br /><br /> A blind preacher for the pin-eyed congregation<br /><br /> It must be easy to loathe<br /><br /><br /><br /> Oh but I ain't one to call names<br /><br /> Or throw stones in a house of glass<br /><br /> You try me<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is a motherfuckin' invitation<br /><br /> The only one you could ever need<br /><br /> This is a motherfuckin' invitation<br /><br /> You try me<br /><br /><br /><br /> You can tell the same lie a thousand times<br /><br /> But it never gets any more true<br /><br /> So close your eyes once more and once more believe<br /><br /> That they all still believe in you<br /><br /><br /><br /> Just one time<br /><br /> This is a motherfuckin' invitation<br /><br /> The only one you could ever need<br /><br /> This is a motherfuckin' invitation<br /><br /> Just one time<br /><br /><br /><br /> This is a motherfuckin' invitation<br /><br /> Ya' try me<br /><br /><br /><br /> Just one time(ya' try me)<br /><br /> Just one time(ya' try me)<br /><br /><br /><br /> Ya' try me
