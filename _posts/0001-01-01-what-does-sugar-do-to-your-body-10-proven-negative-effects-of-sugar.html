Sugar can give you wrinkles and adds age to your face<br /><br />Scientists from the Leiden University Medical Centre, in the Netherlands, measured the blood sugar levels of 600 men and women aged between 50 and 70.<br /><br />In fact, for every 1mm/liter increase in blood sugar, the perceived age of that person rose by five months.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.research.leiden.edu/news/looking-older-blood-sugar-plays-a-role.html">http://www.research.leiden.edu/news/looking-older-blood-sugar-plays-a-role.html</a><br /><br />#2. Sugar is Also Associated With Acne<br /><br />Foods ranked high on the Glycemic Index such as sugar and refined carbs have been associated with greater amounts of acne on the face and body according to the latest research.<br /><br />A study of Australian men showed that those who ate a diet with a low glycemic load saw a great reduction in overall acne.<br /><br />It was a small study with only 23 men but is still food for thought. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.aad.org/media/news-releases/growing-evidence-suggests-possible-link-between-diet-and-acne">https://www.aad.org/media/news-releases/growing-evidence-suggests-possible-link-between-diet-and-acne</a><br /><br />#3. Sugary drinks cause an 83% increase in developing type II diabetes<br /><br />In one study of 91,249 women showed those who consumed 1 sugar-sweetened beverage a day had an 83% increased risk of developing type II diabetes compared to those who had only 1 a month. <br /><br />#4. People who eat sugar are at a much higher risk of cancer<br /><br />There has been a direct link seen between breast, and colon cancer with sugar consumption. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0306987783900956">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0306987783900956</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/6/9/677.short">http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/6/9/677.short</a><br /><br /><br />This is likely due to the fact that insulin is one of the key factors behind the growth and multiplication of cells, and sugar spikes insulin to abnormally high levels. <br /><br />#5. Sugar Can Ruin Your Teeth<br /><br />A study by the American Journal of clinical nutrition showed that sugar destroys the healthy bacteria in our mouth. This can cause tooth erosions and may dim that bright smile. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/4/881S.full">http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/4/881S.full</a><br /><br />What about sugar and weight gain?<br /><br />There are 5 proven reason sugar leads to added weight gain...  <br /><br />#6. Sugar is the premier definition of empty calories. <br /><br />It has no real nutritional value, no nutrients, no minerals, no proteins, and no fiber. Because of this lack of nutrients…<br /><br />#7. Sugar makes you feel hungry<br /><br />In a study by Yale University, those that consumed sugar had an INCREASED appetite and desire for more food.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2013/01/15/overeating-linked-to-sugar-consumption/">http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2013/01/15/overeating-linked-to-sugar-consumption/</a><br /><br />So not only does sugar fill you with empty calories, it makes you want more of those calories. <br /><br />This process happens because sugar screws up hormonal levels in the body. Which leads to   <br /><br />#8. Sugar blocks leptin and raises insulin to supernatural levels<br /><br />Leptin is a hormone in charge of telling us we’re full and need to stop eating. It also tells us we have energy and should go out and use that energy. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18703413">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18703413</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15111494">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15111494</a><br /><br />Sugar consumption blocks this hormone from doing its job and from reaching the brain. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-7075-2-5">http://nutritionandmetabolism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-7075-2-5</a><br /><br />9. Sugar causes belly fat<br /><br />Numerous studies have shown direct links from sugar to increased accumulation of belly fat. <br /><br />Despite knowing all this, it’s hard to stop eating sugar because <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jci.org/articles/view/37385">http://www.jci.org/articles/view/37385</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19248858">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19248858</a><br /><br /><br />#10. Sugar is addictive<br /><br />Similar to drugs like cocaine, scientists have now shown that sugar causes a very similar release of dopamine in the brain. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235907">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235907</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851032/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851032/</a><br /><br />Studies on neuroplasticity have shown that drug users have similar behavioral addictions to those addicted to sugar.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139704/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139704/</a><br /><br />Point black. Sugar is ADDICTING and comes without the immediate social repercussions of frequent drug use. That’s why it’s so hard to stop eating it. <br /><br />How much should you eat per day?<br /><br />None. There is not a reason to be eating this food in your diet, but only on the rare occasion as a treat. <br /><br />What about fruit?<br /><br />Fruit has fiber, vitamins, minerals, water, and tons of nutrients that refined sugar does not have. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5001">http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f5001</a> <br /><br />Sticking to whole sources like apples, oranges, and berries are a better idea. <br /><br />What should you do if you can’t stop eating sugar?<br /><br />I think this subject needs to be covered in greater detail, so either next week or sometime soon we will be making a video about breaking sugar addiction if that’s something you guys want.
