Regulations are being rolled out, and the OCC is familiarizing banks with this technology.  The OCC is giving clear guidelines.  Law makers around the globe are hinting at what's to come.  The crypto sphere is gaining traction mainly because it anticipates regulation. <br /><br />Ripple and xRp are going to peg currency from hyperinflation.  Gold and silver.. <br /><br />The financial system is built off of ancient legacy systems that are slow and prone to errors.  I have heard stories that people won't pay debts and ask the creditor for an itemized bill.  If the creditor fails to provide the itemized bill, then they didn't have to pay their debt.  These inefficiencies happen because we are working off of legacy systems.  Blockchains' ideal use case is for financial instruments due to their audit able nature.  This is going to increase efficiency in the financial markets that we desperately need, and efficiency means cost savings and reduction of friction.  An efficient market is a productive market. We need this in today's market due to the fact  that inflation/stimulus is not increasing productivity, but instead diluting money.  <br /><br />When she was head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde organized the Bali Fintech agenda.  Ripple was part of the Bali Fintech agenda.  Now Christine is head of the ECB and pushing for a digital euro, and the ECB is voting for the digital euro with a decision made by Mid jan 2021.  At this moment, she believes they are moving forward with the digital euro.  She has had a long history with ripple, and Brad has stated that Central banks are looking into the XRP ledger to issue CBDC.  <br /><br />There are many methods for CBDC roll out.  The method that will work the best is a digital asset platform, where these digital assets and CBDCS can work hand in hand.  Customizing solutions by plugging in a public blockchain, private blockchain, or CBDC will allow the pieces to fit together as if they were legos.  <br /><br />We are watching history unfold. Blockchain or cryptocurrency or bitcoin like assets are taking over the next gen financial system.  Come to my channel for the latest cryptocurrency news!  The bitcoin inspired software is going to save the world from a financial crisis!  <br /><br />Crypto investors are taking the risk because we were in crypto in the early stages.  Since we are bearing the larger part of the risk, the reward will be proportioned to the risk we take.  Crypto is making a name for itself, and its growth is limitless.  Understand that where we are as of today, the majority of the institutional development has not even begun. We crypto investors were here with packed bags before they even decided to test it or cement legal regulations.  As we move forward and the space continues to grow and become regulated, the monetary rewards will be leveraged in our favor.  <br /><br /><br /> This is where public blockchains come into play.  Networks exchanging value securely and efficiently is what technologies like Ripple or Stellar offer the banking communities.  Banks will install this software and communicate to each other directly vs going through the current process of centralized swift.
