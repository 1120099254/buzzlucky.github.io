In this video I explore the possible answers to what we can currently accomplish, but leave room open for future advancements in technology. Anti-matter for example holds significantly more destructive power than any other material we are currently aware of, but the production of it in great quantities is currently impossible. Both antimatter applications and kinetic energy strikes will be explored in future videos :)<br /><br />Please Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2dB7VTO">http://bit.ly/2dB7VTO</a><br /><br />Music is by Brandon Maahs.
