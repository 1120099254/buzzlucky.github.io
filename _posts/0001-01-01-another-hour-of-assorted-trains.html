An hour compilation of my videos that for one reason or another, I haven't used yet, that I had to put together quickly before the YouTube editor was abolished. Some older, some newer. Many are incomplete, poorly done, boring, or have been unused for some reason. Lots of random trains including autoracks, coal trains, locals, light power moves, Amtraks, EMD's &amp; GE's and various spots, mainly St Denis, Relay, and the Old Main Line in Patapsco Valley, plus Ellicott City. Plus a couple extra non-train random vids thrown in. It got too complicated, so I just started using whatever was handy to fill an hour, then start again. Some of these are more organized, some are not organized at all! I made about 50 of these 1-hour mish-mashes of random vids, and will be putting them up weekly until the new year, and into the new year! Thanks for watching and please like, comment, and subscribe!!
