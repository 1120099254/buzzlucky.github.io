a Fantastoc song showing how the Rhodeisians overcame everything the world threw at them (sadly even the Mother country, led by communists)<br /><br /><br /><br />lyrics <br /><br /><br /><br />The Whenve Song<br /><br /><br /><br />Whenwe, whenwe, whenwe, whenwe, whenwe, whenwe, whenwe, whenwe, whenwe, whenwe, whenwe, when when we...<br /><br /><br /><br />When we cross the mighty Pungwe<br /><br />The gooks were righty angry<br /><br />When we caught them with their pants down on parade...<br /><br />When we visited Chimoio<br /><br />They weren't full of joy-o<br /><br />'Cause we messed up all the killing plans they made...<br /><br /><br /><br />When we fley beneath the radar<br /><br />Wit the guts of Douglas Bader<br /><br />When we dropped the fireworks at Westlands Farm...<br /><br />When we popped into Lusaka<br /><br />And made a quick departure<br /><br />'Cause we weren't there to visit or to charm...<br /><br /><br /><br />R:They don't forget their Poppy Day, the Battle of the Boyne<br /><br />And many worthless anniversary<br /><br />They don't forget their May Day, V-E and V-J Day<br /><br />They don't forget so why in the hell should we?<br /><br /><br /><br />When we crossed the world embargos<br /><br />And we still got our cargos<br /><br />Like Boeing 720s and the like...<br /><br />When we got a note of thanks<br /><br />For the great big Russian tanks<br /><br />That we hijacked somewhere in the pale moonlight...<br /><br /><br /><br />When we made our own munitions<br /><br />And security inventions<br /><br />When we sent the kids to school with gun in hand...<br /><br />When we thought it's just a trifle<br /><br />For a girl to tote a rifle<br /><br />'Twas just a daily routine in our land...<br /><br /><br /><br />R:They don't forget their Poppy Day, the Battle of the Boyne<br /><br />And many worthless anniversary.<br /><br />They don't forget their May Day, V-E and V-J Day<br /><br />They don't forget so why in the hell should we?<br /><br /><br /><br />When we buried trooper Brading<br /><br />And did our last parading<br /><br />When we moved the Troopie statue to the south...<br /><br />When we joined the other nations<br /><br />We retain associations<br /><br />And suggest that any critic shut his mouth...<br /><br /><br /><br />When we stop just to remember<br /><br />On The 11th of November...<br /><br />When we think of fallen comrades on that day...<br /><br />When we think of all the sad times,<br /><br />We think of all the glad times<br /><br />Rhodesians never die - that's what they say!<br /><br /><br /><br />R:They don't forget their Poppy Day, the Battle of the Boyne<br /><br />And many worthless anniversary.<br /><br />They don't forget their May Day, V-E and V-J Day<br /><br />They don't forget so why in the hell should we?
