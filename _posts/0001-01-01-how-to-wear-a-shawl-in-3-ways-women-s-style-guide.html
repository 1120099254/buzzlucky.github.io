When chilly winds of winter begin to settle in, all of us go searching for warm clothes. In desperate scenarios, even dupattas are wrapped around for warmth. However, among all the warm outfits and accessories available, one accessory’s popularity stands out - Shawls. From teens to retired individuals, everyone loves to drape a shawl during winter. So, how about turning on the style quotient of that humble shawl? Want to know how? That’s exactly what this video is for.<br /><br />How to Wear a Shawl in 3 Ways<br /><br />Style 1:<br />Drape the shawl over your shoulders and arms like a garland. Take both the hanging ends of the shawl and tie them behind your back. Voila, a simple fix has given you a regal look. <br /><br />Style 2:  <br />Wrap the muffler around your neck once and then tie both the hanging ends in a knot. With that, you have got a quirky accessory with an eye-catching appeal.<br /><br />Style 3: <br />Wrap the shawl in a way that it completely envelopes your back and arms. Bring the midsection of the shawl’s both ends to give a coat like appearance. Join the sections together for good with a safety pin. <br /><br />So, those are some easy ways to style a shawl with a number of outfits.
