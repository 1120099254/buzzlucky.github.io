“If every life counts, we should count every life,” says Claire Melamed. And yet, there are countless (literally!) unregistered people and small communities, all around the world. In this eye-opening talk, Melamed, of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data, shares the impact that a lack of data has on the lives of the uncounted. <br /><br />TEDArchive presents previously unpublished talks from TED conferences.<br />Enjoy this edited talk by Claire Melamed.<br />Filmed at We the Future: Talks from TED, Skoll Foundation and United Nations Foundation.<br />NOTE: Comments are disabled on this video. We made this difficult decision for the TED Archive because we believe that a well-moderated conversation allows for better commentary from more people and more viewpoints. Studies show that aggressive and hateful comments silence other commenters and drive them away; unfortunately, YouTube's comment moderation tools are simply not up to the task of allowing us to monitor comments on so many videos at once. (We'd love to see this change, YouTube.) So for now, if you'd like to comment on this talk, please use Facebook, Twitter or G+  to discuss with your networks.
