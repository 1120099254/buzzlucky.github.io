Originally released in 2011, Andromeda was our first single within our &quot;As Embers Turn to Dust&quot; continual concept story.  The first song that opened our minds to the possibilities.  Five years and four full length albums later, we celebrate &quot;As Embers Turn to Dust&quot; with a remixed and updated version of Andromeda.  <br /><br />This will be included in our upcoming multi album box set.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mechinamusic.bandcamp.com/">https://mechinamusic.bandcamp.com/</a><br /><br /><br />Lyrics<br /><br /><br /><br />Exiled in orbit<br />Forced to reflect<br />On what should have been<br />Freedom or bloodshed<br /><br />Assembled in dead stars<br />While my heart remains on earth<br />Lighted by the waning sun<br />Behind this blue earth<br />We are finally free from gods<br />Or men who claim to be<br /><br />I shall cradle<br />This vast darkness<br />Slowly soaring<br />In search of solace<br /><br />Cast down by those who live<br />To lie to themselves<br />Thrown aside to watch all sides<br />Devour themselves from the inside out<br />Countless years, countless lives<br />All wasted on this vicious lie<br />Falsify and amplify this human design<br />To enslave mankind<br /><br />The time has come<br />To advance this flesh<br />Once and for all<br />The time has come<br />To remove god<br />From our lexicon<br />This veil of tears<br />Shall not exist<br />While I am alive<br />I am human<br />Stronger than any god<br /><br />I shall cradle<br />This vast darkness<br />Slowly soaring<br />In search of solace<br /><br />Cast down by those who live<br />To lie to themselves<br />Thrown aside to watch all sides<br />Devour themselves from the inside out<br />Countless years, countless lives<br />All wasted on this vicious lie<br />Falsify and amplify this human design<br />To enslave mankind<br /><br />The time has come<br />To advance this flesh<br />Once and for all<br />The time has come<br />To remove god<br />From our lexicon<br />This veil of tears<br />Shall not exist<br />While I am alive<br />I am human<br />Stronger than any god<br /><br />-Terrametric scan/<br /><br />[Complete]<br /><br />-Atmospheric conditions/<br /><br />[Lethal]<br /><br />-Population stability/<br /><br />[Hostile]<br /><br />//Initialize]../M:<br />:/Reentry_
