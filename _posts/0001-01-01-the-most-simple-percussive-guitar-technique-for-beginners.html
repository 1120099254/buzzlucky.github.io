Why? Because it is done with the thumb, which is the finger that usually plays the bass note of a chord. It is also done on the same string as the bass note of the chord.<br /><br />If the chord you are playing has the bass on the low E string, you will perform the thumb-slap on the low E string. You will do the same with the chords that have the bass note on the A and D string.<br /><br />In this video, we will put the thumb-slap into practice and use it over a beautiful chord progression in E major.<br /><br />Enjoy the lesson.<br /><br />🎸UDEMY COURSES | 63% DISCOUNT <br />Acoustic Guitar Redefined | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/33plRql">https://bit.ly/33plRql</a><br />Acoustic Guitar System | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2qjFYrf">https://bit.ly/2qjFYrf</a><br /><br />🎸FOLLOW ME<br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/blitzguitar/">https://www.instagram.com/blitzguitar/</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/blitzguitar/">https://www.facebook.com/blitzguitar/</a><br />PATREON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/blitzguitar">https://www.patreon.com/blitzguitar</a><br /><br />🎸MY ITALIAN YOUTUBE CHANNEL (GUITAR LESSONS) <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2y0gFuD">https://bit.ly/2y0gFuD</a><br /><br />🎸GEAR I AM USING ATM<br />GUITAR 1: Eko Massimo Varini Signature<br />GUITAR 2: Journey Instrument Sitka Sapele OF410 <br />GUITAR 3: Journey Instrument Carbon Black Top Matte OF660M<br />GUITAR 4: LAVA ME 2 from Lava Music<br />GUITAR 5: AVIAN Skylark 4A<br />EFFECTS: Boss GT10<br />RECORDING: Boss Micro BR80<br />STRINGS: Elixir 010<br />GUITAR MIC: NV TONE Duo Model System (www.nvtone.com)<br /><br />🎸RECORDING<br />CAMERA 1: Canon 80D<br />CAMERA 2: Canon 700D<br />CAMERA 3.

All the courses I post online are available on my Patreon page <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2rMAPYG">https://bit.ly/2rMAPYG</a><br /><br />How long have you been playing guitar?<br />I started playing guitar when I was 10 years old, so it has been more than 20 years. I have always loved fingerpicking guitar, so this is why all my tutorials focus on this topic.<br /><br />Why are you on Patreon?<br />Patreon is great! It allows creators to make money doing what they love. On Patreon, I can share my guitar lessons with my Patrons and get paid for it. As a creator, I feel like Patreon really made a massive difference in the way I share my content :)<br /><br />Do you do concerts?<br />I used to do a lot of gigs in the past. London is a great place to play music almost every day. When my YouTube channel started to grow, I decided to go all-in and try to help as many people as possible learning guitar. This goal takes all the time I have available, so I am not doing any gig or concert atm.<br /><br />© Copyright <br />All the music posted to this channel are created by and belong exclusively to Marco Cirillo. <br /><br />DON'T SAMPLE THE AUDIO FROM MY VIDEOS. <br />VIDEOS AND SONGS THAT USE SAMPLES OF MY MUSIC WILL BE PROMPTLY TAKEN DOWN FROM YOUTUBE, SPOTIFY, APPLE MUSIC, ETC. <br /><br />All my music IS SUBMITTED TO THE YOUTUBE CONTENT ID THROUGH DISTROKID which flags YouTube videos that use the same music so PLEASE DON'T SAMPLE ANY MUSIC FROM MY VIDEOS.
