Jennifer Strum calls the viola the &quot;middle child of the string instruments.&quot; Through a mixture of talk and performance, she offers a compelling meditation on the viola's capacity for emotion-- and for making beautiful music<br /><br />Violist Jennifer Stumm has forged a unique musical path as a dynamic advocate for her   instrument.  Hailed by the Washington Post for the &quot;opal-like beauty&quot; of her playing, she brings the viola into the spotlight with innovative programming and irrepressible enthusiasm.   Jennifer  recently made solo debuts at the Kennedy Center, Weill Hall at Carnegie Hall, and the Ravinia Festival, Chicago, as well as appearing at the Wigmore Hall, the Concergebouw, Amsterdam and at the BBC Proms.  Upcoming she releases her first disc for Naxos of rarely heard 18th century virtuoso works by Alessandro Rolla.  Jennifer is the winner of three major international competitions: Concert Artists Guild, where she was the first violist in the 60 year history of the competition to unanimously take first prize, the William Primrose competition, and the International Competition of Geneva.<br /><br />About TEDx, x = independently organized event<br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)
