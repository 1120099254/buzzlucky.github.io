A third of the Marshall Islandsâ€™ population has moved to the U.S., leaving a country reeling from high unemployment and the looming effects of climate change. NewsHour Weekend Special Correspondent Mike Taibbi reports. This story is part of an ongoing series called &quot;Chasing the Dream,&quot; on poverty and opportunity in America, and was funded in part by Pacific Islanders in Communications.
