20 Moments If It Were Not Filmed, No One Would Believe it.<br /><br />Here are 20 Moments If It Were Not Filmed, No One Would Believe it. For those of you interested on how I make my videos, I primarily use Final Cut Pro X to edit my videos. I use different stock footages (both free and paid), clips of videos that I can find related to the video and search images to visualize the narrative and story that Iâ€™m trying to tell. I hire different researchers and writers for the script for each video along with my our original commentary and hire different voice over actors that can properly convey the the theme of the video. Most importantly, find the best background music, usually royalty free from Incompetech to create an exciting atmosphere while watching the video.<br /><br />#athome #stayhome #withme #lockdown #stayindoors
