Before WWII and the rise of Communism in the East, tens of millions of Germans inhabited the region of Eastern Europe, but now only a paltry handful remain. How and why did nearly 20 million souls disappear from their homelands almost overnight in one of the most stunning vanishing acts in world history?<br /><br />Be sure to let me know your thoughts on these old German communities of Russia, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and many others. Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Sources: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.languagesoftheworld.info/uncategorized/tragic-saga-volga-germans.html">https://www.languagesoftheworld.info/uncategorized/tragic-saga-volga-germans.html</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://eurasianet.org/kyrgyzstan-germans-fading-away-on-central-asian-steppe">https://eurasianet.org/kyrgyzstan-germans-fading-away-on-central-asian-steppe</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thomasgraz.net/glass/map-ethn.htm">http://www.thomasgraz.net/glass/map-ethn.htm</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://religionnews.com/2017/03/16/mennonites-seek-to-come-to-terms-with-nazi-collaboration/">https://religionnews.com/2017/03/16/mennonites-seek-to-come-to-terms-with-nazi-collaboration/</a>
