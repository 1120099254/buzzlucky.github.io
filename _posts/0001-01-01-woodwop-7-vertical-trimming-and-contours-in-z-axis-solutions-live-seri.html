Stiles University's Manny Silva covers how to vary the depth of a vertical trimmer’s cut by creating a contour for the trimmer to follow and how to ensure the trimmer remains relative to the contour’s movement through the Z axis. By keeping the trimmer relative to the contour, we can control the trimmer’s movement in the X, Y, and Z axis throughout the panel. This is important if you don't want to trim at a fixed depth but, instead wants to vary the depth of the cut.
