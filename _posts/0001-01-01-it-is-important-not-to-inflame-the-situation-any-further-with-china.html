It is very important that Prime Minister Scott Morrison must now &quot;take the passion out of this&quot; after a Chinese official posted a doctored image of an Australian soldier on Twitter, according to  ANU Professor John Blaxland. <br /><br />On Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison demanded China apologise for posting the doctored image of an Australian soldier holding a knife to the throat of a child.<br /><br />Mr Morrison had also demanded Twitter remove the violent, fake image but the social media giant has failed to act.<br /><br />Discussing Mr Morrison's response, Professor Blaxland said, &quot;on one level, yes it does appear to be the right move&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;But it's very important now that the prime minister take the passion out of this,&quot; he told Sky News. <br /><br />&quot;And if I can use a cricket analogy, play with a straight bat&quot;. <br /><br />&quot;It's very important that we don't inflame the situation any further&quot;.
