Winter Carp Fishing Tactics, Marcus Clark<br /><br />Angling tactics are vital all year-round, but they are especially so in winter as the carp slow down and feed less, so Marcus Clark describes how he fish's in the cold weather and how he has managed such fantastic results over the years. Marcus talks about bait including Boilies, Tiger Nuts, Hemp, Buck Wheat, Maggots, Casters, Pellets, Boilie Crumb etc. and also describes how and when each are used. Water depth and features are important too, when to fish in the deep silt or shallow areas that can contain gravel and clay. Rigs, location, hookbait presentation and swim choice are also important to Marcus, as well as line lay and bite indication.<br /><br />Marcus fishes an array of different waters from Day Tickets like Farlows, Orchid and Linch Hill's Christchurch or harder Syndicates that includes his current campaign on Tyram Hall in Yorkshire.
