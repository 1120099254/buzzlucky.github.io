The Heaters were one of LA’s hottest live acts in the late ’70s, opening for heavyweights like Talking Heads, Van Halen, Cheap Trick, and more. The Heaters’ explosive stage technique, visual smarts, and great pop songwriting—harkening back to the sound of Phil Spector mixed with the energy of punk—made them the band to see on the Sunset Strip.
