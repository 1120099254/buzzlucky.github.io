This kit includes three colored filters and a 2x Power Doubling Lens. The filters have multiple coatings to maximize light transmission in specific wavelengths to bring out subtle details in the Martian surface. The 2x Power doubling lens doubles the power of any 1.25‚Äù telescope eyepiece and have a built-in T-threads to attach a DSLR camera (T-ring not included). Don't just view Mars, the pieces in this kit can also be used to view Jupiter, Saturn, the Moon and many other astronomical objects.
