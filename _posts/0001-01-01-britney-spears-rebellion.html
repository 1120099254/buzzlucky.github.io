'Cause you're rebellion<br /><br />Be wary of others<br />The ones closest to you (oh)<br />The poison they feed you<br />And the voodoo that they do<br /><br />But in rebellion<br />There's a sparkle of truth<br />Don't just stand there<br />Do what you got to do<br /><br />You'll find it in rebellion<br />Your body starts breathing<br />They're not believing what they're seeing<br />'Cause you're rebellion<br /><br />You'll find it so compelling<br />With everyone yelling<br />'Cause your soul, you're not selling<br />'Cause you're rebellion
