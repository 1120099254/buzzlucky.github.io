Do You Want to Retire Abroad? Affordably? Nicaragua is the most affordable country in Latin America -- a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment in the city center goes for about $219 and a 3-bedroom for $500 and total utilities running about $60/ month. Wifi will set you back $45/month. Live in Nicaragua and your money is worth two to three times more, especially on food, rent. For about $225/month you can have a full time housekeeper who will cook and do all your laundry...is that a luxury you have now?
