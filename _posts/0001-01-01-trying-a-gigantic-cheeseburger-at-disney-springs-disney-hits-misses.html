In today's vlog we head to Disney Springs, formerly Downtown Disney, to try some of the all new food and drink items at some of the different restaurants. There were new Ant-man &amp; the Wasp food items at Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar. There we select places around Disney Springs that had extra small and extra large sized foods in celebration of the new movie coming out! So we tried the gigantic cheeseburger and the tiny empanadas, they were interesting but not super great flavor-wise. We do recommend that you check out Jock Lindsey's though, it really is a well themed and cool hang out spot with lots of little neat features! We also had some of the new food items at Wine Bar George and they were great! We loved the steak frites, so so delicious! We'll be back for sure! Before we headed home for the day we checked out the all new World of Disney Store! We can't wait to see it when it's finally fully finished, they said the grand opening would be in Fall, so we'll keep our eyes peeled for that. We had an awesome trip to Disney Springs, thank you for joining in on the fun! What did you think of the food, what would you try? Let us know in the comments below! Thank you for watching and we'll see you tomorrow with a new vid!  <br /><br />TheTimTracker T-Shirts are now available at <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/TheTimTracker/">https://shop.spreadshirt.com/TheTimTracker/</a><br /><br />Affiliate links to the camera equipment we use:<br />Canon G7X Mark2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2CxCaqD">http://amzn.to/2CxCaqD</a><br />Sony AX53: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2EPn3XO">http://amzn.to/2EPn3XO</a><br />Sony A7Sii: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2CmZPqk">http://amzn.to/2CmZPqk</a><br />Zeiss Batis 2.8/18mm Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2H1lozy">http://amzn.to/2H1lozy</a><br />Sony 28-70mm Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2lOzo6d">http://amzn.to/2lOzo6d</a><br />GoPro Hero 5 Black: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2lPirIH">http://amzn.to/2lPirIH</a><br />Rode Smart Lav+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2GRz7wo">https://amzn.to/2GRz7wo</a><br />Rode Stereo VideoMic Pro: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2HdDzoG">https://amzn.to/2HdDzoG</a><br />Zoom H1n Audio Recorder: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2GSemwC">https://amzn.to/2GSemwC</a><br />Mefoto Roadtrip Tripod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2BPp9IY">http://amzn.to/2BPp9IY</a><br /><br />We finally got a PO Box!!!!
