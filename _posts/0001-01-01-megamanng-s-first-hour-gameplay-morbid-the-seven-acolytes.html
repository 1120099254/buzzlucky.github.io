Now that the embargo has been lifted, we're good to go.<br /><br />This is my showcase of Morbid: The Seven Acolytes for Nintendo Switch. Yeah. It's another Dark Souls like game. Am I complaining? No. Because honestly, I love these kinds of games. It's simple enough but I swear, this game has a tendency to test me in more ways than one. Why? I cover much of the game all the way till I defeat one of the Seven Acolytes. Once you beat the first Acolyte, you have the ability to use your Skill Points to improve several relics that you can use. Doing this can either raise your health, stamina, recovery, etc. It's pretty interesting but enough to challenge and testing your skills.<br /><br />Hope it's to your liking guys.<br /><br />#morbidthesevenacolytes #mergegames #freegame<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Become a Channel Member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUyeGTrUtmLWLHLrjMbe5HQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUyeGTrUtmLWLHLrjMbe5HQ/join</a><br /><br />Become a Patron on my Patreon!
