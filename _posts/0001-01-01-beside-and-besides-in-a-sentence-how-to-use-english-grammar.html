In this video I will show you how to use both 'beside' and 'besides' in a sentence. These are two often-misused and misunderstood connectors. So what is the meaning of the English linking word 'Besides'? How is it different from 'beside' and exactly how do we use it in a sentence? In this video we'll be looking at answers to these questions and I'll give you lots of examples. This will be useful if you're studying for a Cambridge exam such as IELTS, First Certificate (FCE), Advanced (CAE) or Proficiency (CPE).<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL AND CONTINUE IMPROVING YOUR ENGLISH!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=myenglishteacherrob">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=myenglishteacherrob</a><br /><br />COME AND SAY HELLO TO ME OVER ON SOCIAL MEDIA!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/myenglishteacherrob/">https://www.facebook.com/myenglishteacherrob/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MyETRob">https://twitter.com/MyETRob</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/myenglishteacherrob/">https://www.instagram.com/myenglishteacherrob/</a><br /><br />BOOK A PRIVATE 1-1 LESSON WITH ME<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.italki.com/myenglishteacherrob">https://www.italki.com/myenglishteacherrob</a> <br /><br />Music courtesy of the immensely talented Otis McDonald: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCej6bRv8lR48AEbQvdb_9Cg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCej6bRv8lR48AEbQvdb_9Cg</a><br /><br />SFX credits:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freesound.org/s/339809/">https://freesound.org/s/339809/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freesound.org/s/31189/">https://freesound.org/s/31189/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freesound.org/s/209237/">https://freesound.org/s/209237/</a><br /><br />SIGN UP FOR ITALKI AND RECEIVE 10$ FREE CREDIT AFTER YOUR FIRST LESSON <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.italki.com/i/ABeGbe">https://www.italki.com/i/ABeGbe</a> (AFFILIATE LINK)<br /><br />TRAVELLING TO ENGLAND AND NEED ACCOMMODATION?
