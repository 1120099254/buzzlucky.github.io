A break in the weather brings another busy day on the farm, with many jobs to start, but I can't seem to finish any of them. Some days go that way! Hilarie and I start by tilting solar panels, then get to work on building the chicken house. The loader parts for the 656 tractor come in the mail, and Dad and I take a look at how to mount the quick attach on the tractor. I start repacking the 656 tractor wheel bearings, but the day ends before I can finish. Finally, homegrown chicken is for dinner, and I show my favorite way for how to grill a whole chicken. <br /><br /><br /><br />website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://justafewacres.com/">http://justafewacres.com/</a><br /><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Just-a-few-acres-farm-187074114794963/">https://www.facebook.com/Just-a-few-acres-farm-187074114794963/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/justafewacresfarm/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/justafewacresfarm/?hl=en</a><br />email: peterelarson3@gmail.com<br /><br />To order Pete's book; &quot;A Year and a Day on Just a Few Acres:&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Year-Day-Just-Few-Acres/dp/149549957X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NM8AQPCG3IT5&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=a+year+and+a+day+on+just+a+few+acres&amp;qid=1587327049&amp;sprefix=a+year+and+a+day+on+just%2Caps%2C183&amp;sr=8-1">https://www.amazon.com/Year-Day-Just-Few-Acres/dp/149549957X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NM8AQPCG3IT5&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=a+year+and+a+day+on+just+a+few+acres&amp;qid=1587327049&amp;sprefix=a+year+and+a+day+on+just%2Caps%2C183&amp;sr=8-1</a>
