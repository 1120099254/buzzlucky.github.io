Most often used phrases. <br />One of the key principles of getting fluency in English is the idea of learning and memorizing phrases instead of individual words. <br />Phrases are the core of regular communication. <br />We use them all the time.<br />It’s much more effective to memorize phrases versus individual words because phrases already have all the necessary grammar inside and you don’t need to figure out why the phrase sounds this or that way. That is a fixed form! You should just memorize them and use in communication. <br />_______________________________________________________________<br />Free 7-Day Video Course about how to get fluent in English the fastest and natural way: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://engspeaker.com/Subscribe%20to%20free%20Video%20Course.html">http://engspeaker.com/Subscribe%20to%20free%20Video%20Course.html</a><br /><br />Группа «BKонтакте»: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vk.com/club106971867">https://vk.com/club106971867</a><br /><br />Индивидуальные занятия по Skype: Veche2011<br />____________________________________________________<br /><br />Comments, likes, questions are apreciated! <br /><br />Thanks for watching, subscription and likes!<br /><br />If you need titles push the button in the right corner of the screen!!!
