Is your English essay hiding somewhere in your Borderlands 2 game saves folder? Is the word &quot;backup&quot; something you only say when playing co-op video games? If so, IT'S TIME TO STOP.<br /><br />Today, I'll share a simple process for organizing the files on your computer - and keeping them that way. We'll build a simple-yet-flexible system of folders that will make it easy to find anything you need. We'll also talk about cloud syncing, the best way to name your files, backup options, and dig a bit into shortcuts and other ways to access frequently-used files quickly.<br /><br />---<br />#organization #productivity #backtoschool<br />---<br /><br />Watch my video on Paper File Organization next:<br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LeibeXAog">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LeibeXAog</a><br /><br />üìóGet my book &quot;10 Steps to Earning Awesome Grades&quot; FREE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/get-better-grades/">https://collegeinfogeek.com/get-better-grades/</a><br /><br />üê¶Follow Me:<br />Instagram ‚ûî <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/tomfrankly">https://instagram.com/tomfrankly</a><br />Twitter ‚ûî <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tomfrankly">https://twitter.com/tomfrankly</a><br />Podcast ‚ûî <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/TheCollegeInfoGeekPodcast">https://www.youtube.com/TheCollegeInfoGeekPodcast</a><br />Spotify Study Playlist ‚ûî <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/thomasfrank09/playlist/4ETfiRPHVmUFLF6q0g8Fux?si=IPfx3dAgQ1SIUwhh5YEQMQ">https://open.spotify.com/user/thomasfrank09/playlist/4ETfiRPHVmUFLF6q0g8Fux?si=IPfx3dAgQ1SIUwhh5YEQMQ</a><br /><br />üì°Subscribe to My Channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://buff.ly/1vQP5ar">http://buff.ly/1vQP5ar</a><br /><br />‚è∞Timestamps:<br />01:41 - Two important rules for file organization<br />02:22 - The tree structure explained<br />04:08 - In-depth look at my folder structure<br />07:31 - How to name your files<br />08:33 - The best cloud sync app (and why you need it)<br />10:30 - How to back up your files (cloud sync isn't enough)<br />13:09 - Use shortcuts and quick access<br />14:36 - Audible and a book recommendation<br /><br />üñ±Links from the video:<br />- Google One: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://one.google.com/about">https://one.google.com/about</a><br />- Data-curator File Tree: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://github.com/roboyoshi/datacurator-filetree">https://github.com/roboyoshi/datacurator-filetree</a><br /><br />üé•My Video Gear:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/thomasfrank">https://www.amazon.com/shop/thomasfrank</a><br /><br />üéßBackground music via Musicbed.
