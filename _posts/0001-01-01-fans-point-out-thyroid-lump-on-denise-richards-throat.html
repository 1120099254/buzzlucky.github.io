Denise Richards is thanking eagle-eyed fans after they noticed a large lump on her throat during the “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” reunion. It's not the first time a television viewer has seen something and said something. Several viewers noticed a lump on Inside Edition anchor Deborah Norville’s neck. For years it was nothing, she said. Then in April, she had surgery to remove a cancerous thyroid nodule. In 2015, Tarek El Moussa of HGTV’s “Flip or Flop” was also alerted by a viewer.
