Featuring unprecedented access to the famous ballet institution, the series follows the lives of the students ages 8 to 18 pursuing their dreams to become ballet dancers. While older students from all over the country rigorously train for professional careers, younger students from New York City are put through their paces as they rehearse and perform in New York City Ballet's holiday classic &quot;George Balanchine's The Nutcracker&quot; onstage at Lincoln Center.<br /><br />Coming to Disney+ on Friday 18th December.<br /><br />#DisneyPlus <br /><br />VISIT ONLINE - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.WhatsOnDisneyPlus.com">http://www.WhatsOnDisneyPlus.com</a><br /><br />JOIN THE CLUB <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC99lFugkkvslALTl_RLVn_Q/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC99lFugkkvslALTl_RLVn_Q/join</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.Patreon.com/WhatsOnDisneyPlus">http://www.Patreon.com/WhatsOnDisneyPlus</a><br /><br />FOLLOW ON TWITTER -  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://Twitter.com/DisneyPlusNews">http://Twitter.com/DisneyPlusNews</a><br /> <br />FOLLOW ON INSTAGRAM -  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/WhatsOnDisneyPlus">http://instagram.com/WhatsOnDisneyPlus</a><br /><br />LIKE ON FACEBOOK - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/WhatsOnDisneyPlus">http://facebook.com/WhatsOnDisneyPlus</a>
