We want you to have the same opportunity to connect with us online as you have when youâ€™re here with us on campus. Please consider filling out a short Connect Card at ccchapel.com/connect or to find your Next Step here at CCC, reach out to us at NextSteps@ccchapel.com. We also know this is a very difficult time for many, and either you or someone close to you may need assistance. For more information or to connect with someone from our Care Team, please email care@ccchapel.com. <br /><br />If you are a part of our church family and want to give, please head to hudson.ccchapel.com/give.
