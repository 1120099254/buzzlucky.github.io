In the beginning of 2017, we met Mac DeMarco in Berlin - he was on tour all year, until he stopped by in Cologne to play a sold-out show at Kantine. We decided to shoot another video, this time for his song &quot;One Another&quot;.<br /><br />â–ºâ–º Read the full story here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cardinalsessions.com/mac-demarco/">http://cardinalsessions.com/mac-demarco/</a><br /><br />ðŸ“ŒDISCOVER NEW MUSIC EVERY THURSDAY AND BE A PART OF OUR JOURNEY â–ºâ–º <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubscribeOurChannel">http://bit.ly/SubscribeOurChannel</a><br /><br /><br />â–ºâ–º Subscribe on Youtube // <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubscribeOurChannel">http://bit.ly/SubscribeOurChannel</a><br />â–ºâ–º Facebook // <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/CardinalSessionsOnFacebook">http://bit.ly/CardinalSessionsOnFacebook</a><br />â–ºâ–º Instagram // <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/CardinalSessionsInstagram">http://bit.ly/CardinalSessionsInstagram</a><br />â–ºâ–º Our Website // <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cardinalsessions.com">http://cardinalsessions.com</a><br /><br />__<br /><br />Cardinal Sessions was founded in the summer of 2010. They challenge the classic music video and try to replace impersonal footage with immediate and emotional snapshots.<br /><br />Bands from all over the world with their different genres present their songs reduced to the essence of the musical spectrum - only vocals and unplugged instruments. Due to the spontaneous live-aspect and the approach to record every song without any additional rehearsal, songs emerge that often sound significantly different to their album versions.<br /><br />We film on locations that the musicians mostly choose by themselves: remote places, frequented streets, parks, woods, fields, bars; nothing is impossible. We have accomplished our goal if the location fits well to the background of the music we and the artists want to present. But our most important purpose is that there are no borders: we film everything that we like, no matter how popular, famous or also unknown a band might be. It is still important for us to support local talents and it will always stay part of our concept.<br /><br />The Cardinal Sessions team can also be booked: for example to film short documentaries of album recordings, studio recordings or live concert moments that you want to capture.<br />Send an email to info[at]cardinalsessions.com.<br /><br />â–ºâ–º Cardinal Sessions 2017 Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpg717GV0CvwrgKWXWZAbSr3RT5aqlEgE">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpg717GV0CvwrgKWXWZAbSr3RT5aqlEgE</a><br /><br />â–ºâ–º Cardinal Sessions 2016 Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpg717GV0Cvwez5v8nzr4woFsxptBfHPZ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpg717GV0Cvwez5v8nzr4woFsxptBfHPZ</a><br /><br />â–ºâ–º Cardinal Sessions Must Watch Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpg717GV0Cvybmqq9VbCRidnBI6RWzNIk">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpg717GV0Cvybmqq9VbCRidnBI6RWzNIk</a>
