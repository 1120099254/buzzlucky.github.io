#producer #popmusic #logicpro<br />In this production tutorial, I use the elements of &quot;Dynamite&quot; by BTS to create my own K-Pop track. <br /><br />Watch me listen to Dynamite and analyze it: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FoG_3YamRrM">https://youtu.be/FoG_3YamRrM</a><br /><br />Everything must groove! In order to create a track like Dynamite in Logic Pro, I started with a basic drum beat playing quarter-notes. After that I ignored the grid entirely and started adding live piano, bass, and guitar to give the track a laid back feel. I love how the original BTS song drags so many elements behind the beat (the claps, the bass, and especially the vocals.) <br /><br />With each element, I listened carefully to everything I had already played to make sure that it felt good. With no DAW grid to rely on, you have to turn everything over to your ear. How do you think I did? Let me know in the comments!<br /><br />Click here for more song analysis and production breakdowns: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS31X5NJ3dwqw_jrcXnLQLPrUxWJxCDF6">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS31X5NJ3dwqw_jrcXnLQLPrUxWJxCDF6</a><br /><br />Check out my other series on songs with Really Cool Harmony: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS31X5NJ3dwp_ldcyL5xgKSv8gNBNcHBF">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS31X5NJ3dwp_ldcyL5xgKSv8gNBNcHBF</a><br /><br />Featured in the video: <br />DT-770 Studio Monitoring Headphones: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZTpaq7">https://amzn.to/2ZTpaq7</a><br />Snark Instrument Tuner: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2RPAsqd">https://amzn.to/2RPAsqd</a><br />Arturia Minibrute Synthesizer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3056IuN">https://amzn.to/3056IuN</a>
