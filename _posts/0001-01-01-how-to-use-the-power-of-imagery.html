Imagery is one of the most powerful tools that I use while working with clients. Many people try and think their way through things, rather than creating a picture of what they want. Imagery is able to help clarify within your own mind what you want and how you want it to look. <br />Imagery is not only about creating pictures in your mind. Many people believe that in order to do imagery or have success with it you have to be able to create these very detailed images. However, imagery is more than just pictures, it is about involving all of your senses, taste, touch, smell, feeling, sight and noises. Each person will have senses, much like attention skills, that are more developed, and these are the senses we want to incorporate more strongly.<br />When I guide some people through imagery they do not pick up much in terms of what they see. However, they can feel themselves going through the motions, or can hear the sounds, or the smells of the location they are in. It is important when working with imagery to make it work for you and cater to your strengths. No two people will imagine things the same way, so just because you don’t see pictures doesn’t mean you are not capable of using imagery and benefiting from it. <br /><br />#visualization<br />#sportpsychology<br />#mentalskills<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://qpathlete.com/sports-imagery/">http://qpathlete.com/sports-imagery/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://qpathlete.com/use-imagery/">http://qpathlete.com/use-imagery/</a><br /><br />------------------------------------------------<br />Please like, comment, share and subscribe to our channel<br /><br />Follow me on all of my social media platforms to stay up to date with my newest tips, ideas and techniques to build your mind, body and life. <br /><br />YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Balanced...">https://www.youtube.com/user/Balanced...</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/quantumperfo...">https://www.facebook.com/quantumperfo...</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/qpathlete/">https://www.instagram.com/qpathlete/</a><br /><br />Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://qpathlete.com/focus-achieve-peak-performance/">http://qpathlete.com/focus-achieve-peak-performance/</a><br /><br />Kate Allgood<br />Masters Sport Psychology (with distinction)<br />Masters General Psychology (with distinction) <br />Sports Hypnosis Certification <br />Muscle Activation Techniques Certification
