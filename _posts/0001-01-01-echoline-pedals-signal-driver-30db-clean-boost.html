Inside this one knob wonder is clean boost capable of raising your signal by 30dB. Use the Signal Driver to add gain to other dirt pedals or place it after to increase the loudness, without changing tone. It also loves to placed in an amp’s FX Loop to add volume. When bypasses, the Signal Driver is still working, offering a high quality class-A line driver to make sure long cables or a run of true bypass pedals don’t degrade your signal.<br />The high tolerance metal film resistors and WIMA caps means low noise and high fidelity, while the heavy duty components and laser etched enclosure make this boost a valuable asset to any board. Plus, Echoline which is handmade in England includes a red Dymo label for fans looking to transform this boost into the legendary Primary Driver that blasted Marty McFly across the room!
