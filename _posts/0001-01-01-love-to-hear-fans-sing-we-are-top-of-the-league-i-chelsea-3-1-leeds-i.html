-TIMESTAMPS-<br />00:10 Can fans think the title might be coming?<br />There is nothing wrong with the fans thinking that. It was great for the fans to be back, but it's a long season and we have to show how consistent we can be. We have a long way to go and we have to be grounded.<br />2:30 Giroud<br />I didn't talk to him about the ice pack. His performance was great. He could have had two or three more, but I have options and I know I can rely on him.<br />3:25 Pulisic<br />Really pleased today, it's been a difficult period for him. I thought it was wise to put him on the bench. I was delighted he got the goal.<br /><br />Frank Lampard reacts to Chelseaâ€™s 3-1 victory against Leeds at Stamford Bridge.<br /><br />HaytersTV â€“ Football Up Close.
