Despite a massive focus on women in the workplace, progress towards a gender equal workplace is slow. What needs to change? <br /><br />This talk calls for an equal focus on confidence, capability and childcare as the true drivers of change. Itâ€™s time to call out the current gender equality bandwagon and move on to a new, truly equal approach to work. www.womenatwork.org.uk Caroline has spent the majority of her career in the travel industry working for companies such as American Express, Cisco, Yahoo and AstraZeneca.  Caroline co-founded consultancy Festive Road and has also volunteered as the Institute of Travel Management Chairman, Global Business Travel Association Europe President and has received a number of awards in recognition of her services to the industry. <br /><br />Most recently these include IBM iX everywoman Entrepreneur of the Year 2018 and Business Travel News Top 25 most influential people 2018.  In her spare time Caroline co-leads support network Women at Work, and delivers a number of industry education programmes. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
