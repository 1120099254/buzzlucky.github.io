I am THE last person on the planet to play Castlevania Symphony of The Night. I've played all the other ones except this one. So it's also my first time hearing the Master Librarian theme. But when I noticed the audio lines sync up perfectly with the song, I couldn't get this out of my head so I had to put it together. The lines I got from a Symphony of The Night soundboard I found somewhere on the internet.<br /><br />Castlevania is owned by its respective people etc. And also thanks to whoever made the Symphony of The Night soundboard I used to make this thing.
