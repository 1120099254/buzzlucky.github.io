Stephen Gately, one of the leading lights of the Irish pop group Boyzone, died tragically in 2009. Ten years earlier, at the age of 23, he contributed this beautifully sung number to a CD entitled &quot;Abbamania&quot; that featured assorted British goups and solo artists. It was followed by a televised studio programme in which they all repeated their contributions, so here is Stephen in Abba's &quot;Chiquitita.&quot;
