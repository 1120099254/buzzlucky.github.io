This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways to the lungs. It makes breathing difficult and can make some physical activities difficult or even impossible. Asthma symptoms occur when the lining of your airways swell and the muscles around them tighten. The mucus then fills the airways, further reducing the amount of air that can pass through.<br />Asthma signs and symptoms include:<br />1. Shortness of breath<br />2. Chest tightness or pain<br />3. Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing<br />4. A whistling or wheezing sound when exhaling (wheezing is a common sign of asthma in children)<br />5. Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu<br /><br />Asthma triggers<br />Exposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies (allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include:<br />1. Airborne substances, such as pollen, dust mites, mould spores, pet dander or particles of cockroach waste<br />2. Respiratory infections, such as the common cold<br />3. Physical activity (exercise-induced asthma)<br />4. Cold air<br />5. Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke<br /><br /><br />Get in touch with the solution by just clicking following links- <br /><br />Facebook Group- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/solutionpharamcy">https://www.facebook.com/groups/solutionpharamcy</a><br />Facebook Page- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pharmavideo/">https://www.facebook.com/pharmavideo/</a><br />New channel (Pharmacy Dictionary) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6OXVV_2oxf5DD0Mad6e9A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6OXVV_2oxf5DD0Mad6e9A</a><br />Instagram- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/solutionpharmacy/">https://www.instagram.com/solutionpharmacy/</a><br />E-Mail for official and other work - solutionpharmacy@gmail.com<br />LinkedIn- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://linkedin.com/in/pushpendrakpatel">http://linkedin.com/in/pushpendrakpatel</a><br />#solutionpharmacy #Pharmacologyclass #GPATonlinetest
