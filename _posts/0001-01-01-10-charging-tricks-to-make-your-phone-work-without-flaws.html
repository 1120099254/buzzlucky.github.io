You’d never know it, but the way you charge your phone can be crucial for not only your electricity bills and safety, but also the lifespan of its battery. The phone batteries used today are based on a precise number of charge cycles and to make them last longer, it is advised to never charge them to 100% or drain them to 0%.<br /><br />If, for some reason, you wanna discontinue your phone use for some time, charge it to 50% and turn it off. This percentage is said to be the healthiest for a lithium-ion battery. With this level of charge, you can store it for months with the least possible damage to your gadget. And don’t forget to turn it on every once in a while and top off the battery. But there are also other tips about the right way to charge your phone, so you can use it in the best way possible and avoid any dangers.<br /><br />#brightside<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />Ignoring fast charge 0:01<br />Letting your phone go to 0% charge 0:34<br />Using random chargers 1:00<br />Charging your phone in public places 1:29<br />Going out without a power bank 1:56<br />Using charge-saving apps 2:24<br />Charging the phone in the car 2:54<br />Charging the phone overnight 3:29<br />Using your phone while it’s charging 4:08<br />Leaving the phone cover on while charging 4:35<br />Stopping using your gadget with too little or too much juice 5:09<br />Not saving the charge correctly 5:36<br />Using the charger during a thunderstorm 6:27<br />Charging your phone with a laptop 7:04<br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>
