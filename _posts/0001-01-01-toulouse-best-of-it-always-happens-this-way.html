With 1,102,882 inhabitants as of 1 January 2006,[1] the Toulouse metropolitan area is the fourth-largest in France, after Paris (11.8 million), Lyon (1.8 million), Marseille (1.7 million).<br />Toulouse is one of the bases of the European aerospace industry, with the headquarters of Airbus, Galileo positioning system, the SPOT satellite system, and CNES's Toulouse Space Centre (CST), the largest space centre in Europe.[2] Thales Alenia Space, Europe's largest[citation needed] satellite manufacturer, and Astrium Satellites, EADS's satellite system subsidiary, also have a significant presence in Toulouse. Its world renowned university is one of the oldest in Europe (founded in 1229) and, with more than 97,000 students, is with Lille the third-largest university campus of France after Paris and Lyon.[3]<br />Toulouse was the capital of the former province of Languedoc (provinces were abolished during the French Revolution). It is now the Chef-lieu of the Midi-Pyrénées region, the largest region in metropolitan France. It is also the Chef-lieu of the Haute-Garonne department.
