Here is my version of a advanced useless machine.<br />I didn't made any documentation. All I have for the short term is a list of the used parts. <br />But if you really want me to build a machine for you: write me a private message on YouTube. <br /><br />Parts Used:<br />- Old inkjet printer<br />- 8 Standard switches<br />- RC-Servo <br />- ATmega8<br />- L293D<br />- L7805
