It is necessary to understand the importance of a steering-wheel in daily contact with the driver; it is also important understand how it was made; why the rim is hollow and bends easily in case of accident, etc.<br />We will see there is a central part attached to the rim with radiuses/spokes. The more spokes has a steering-wheel the more expensive would cost to leather wrap it.<br />I hope you find this information useful!<br />Cesar
