New and Improved version!  I am updating my old video with better picture and sound!<br />My thanks to bigband78 for identifying the smooth piped singer! <br />Movie star Fred MacMurray vocals on this  great stock market novelty tune, 5 years before he  would appear before his first Hollywood movie cameras. George Olsen gives it that 1929 pre crash pep, though it was a talkie hit from a  Fox production, High Society Blues, released in early 1930. <br />Young Fred MacMurray was an actor on Broadway in 1930, and also found work as a sax player in Gus Arnheims Orchestra, vocalizing for Victor on some big talkie hits such as this one and Arnheim's &quot;Peach of a Pair&quot;.<br />George Olsen, a New York collegiate dance band that found fame in 1927 as the pit band for the Broadway smash musical, Good News, (Varsity Drag) became the choice of Ziegfeld to  orchestrate his first all  2 strip Technicolor talkie version of his Broadway hit, Whoopee. While in Hollywood, Olsen started his own nite club and recorded Victor hits such as this one.<br /><br />My original description: Written for a Fox  film, &quot;High Society Blues&quot;, starring Farrell and Gaynor. Following a radio introduction and actual film closeup of George Olsen, his  record is heard. Accompanies silent film of stock trading, gambling, ballroom dancing and flapper parties. Roaring twenties pastimes. My video conveys the exciting pre-stock crash mood, though the song came out soon after....when fortunes had been lost and the only things worth trading were shares of &quot;hugs and kisses&quot;.Perhaps the most clever song since 'Yes,We Have No Bananas&quot;   Enjoy!
