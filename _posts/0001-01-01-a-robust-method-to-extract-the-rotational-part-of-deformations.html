This is the accompanying video of our paper M. Müller, J. Bender, N. Chentanez, M. Macklin, A Robust Method to Extract the Rotational Part of Deformations, in Proceedings of ACM Motion in Games. <br /><br />Abstract: We present a novel algorithm to extract the rotational part of an arbitrary 3x3 matrix. This problem lies at the core of two popular simulation methods in computer graphics, the co-rotational Finite Element Method and Shape Matching techniques. In contrast to the traditional method based on polar decomposition, degenerate configurations and inversions are handled robustly and do not have to be treated in a special way. In addition, our method can be implemented with only a few lines of code without branches which makes it particularly well suited for GPU-based applications. We demonstrate the robustness, coherence and efficiency of our method by comparing it to stabilized polar decomposition in several simulation scenarios.
