Presentation given in Oskaloosa, Iowa.  ~The handing writing is on the wall in this nation and across the globe!  It is time for the claimants of Christianity to count the costs of being &quot;all in&quot;.  If you find it to be too high, go ring the bell; but for those who know the exceedingly great reward that is set before them, the costs are are as nothing!<br /><br />The time to stand and be counted among the Warrior Redeemed is now!<br /><br />Jamie Walden<br />www.omegadynamics.com
