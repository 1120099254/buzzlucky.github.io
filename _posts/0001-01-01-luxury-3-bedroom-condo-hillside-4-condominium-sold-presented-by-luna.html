On the opposing side of Hillside 4 lies a small soi [lane or side street] which leads to the aircraft hangar sized Su Khon Tha Mu Katha (more often written as Sukontha Mookata), the quintessential Thai barbeque buffet experience in Chiang Mai; open Monday to Sunday from 5PM to midnight and costing only a smidge over 200 baht for an all-you-can-feast accompanied by live music, diners can choose from an almost mind-numbing selection of fresh seafood and shellfish, meats and raw vegetables as well as scores of prepared dishes, Thai salads, fruit plates, dipping sauces and even desserts and non-alcoholic beverages. Reachable in less than five minutes on foot from the condo is the futuristic-looking Maya Lifestyle Shopping Centre and, across from which, fashionable Nimmanhaemin Road with its mix of trendy bars, eateries, cafés and boutique retail concerns. En route to the ‘Old City’ and barely a 10 minute stroll from Hillside 4 is the supremely utilitarian Kad Suan Kaew, one of Chiang Mai’s very first malls and, to this day, still ever-bustling especially with Thai folk; home to several hundred shops and restaurants, the mall also anchors a Central department store, branches of Tops Market and IT City, two main food courts, a gym, bowling alley and private karaoke cubicles as well as a seven-screen multiplex cinema (though very few films are now presented in English) and, thrice weekly, a delightful night market (Kad Sum Murd) with pop-up stands hawking an array of hearty local fare in addition to cut-price clothing. Onward, a further five minute walk, from the mall is Chiang Mai Ram Hospital and long regarded as the preeminent –if the most expensive- medical hub in the city.<br /><br /><br />More information on living in Thailand here<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://perfecthomes.co.th/chaing-mai...">https://perfecthomes.co.th/chaing-mai...</a><br /><br />**More properties for sale - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://perfecthomes.co.th/property-t...">https://perfecthomes.co.th/property-t...</a><br /><br />**Top 5 things to consider when looking to purchase a house here in Chiang Mai or anywhere in Thailand for that matter.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://perfecthomes.co.th/top-5-thin...">https://perfecthomes.co.th/top-5-thin...</a><br /><br />Disclaimer<br /><br />Prices are fixed in Thai Baht and can be subject to change without any prior notice.
