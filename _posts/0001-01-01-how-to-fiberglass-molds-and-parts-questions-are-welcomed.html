A short lesson on building fiberglass molds and parts.  In this video a motorcycle fender is repaired and given a textured surface.  A mold is then made and a part is made from the mold.  If you have questions or are interested in learning more, then leave a message below and I'll do my best to help you out.  I'll be posting more videos on this so if there's something you want to see...just ask.  And thanks  for watching.
