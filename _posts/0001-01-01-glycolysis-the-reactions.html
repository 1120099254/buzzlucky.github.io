NDSU VCell Production's animation &quot;Glycolysis: The Reactions&quot;. For more information please see <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations.">http://vcell.ndsu.edu/animations.</a><br /><br />Glycolysis oxidizes one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate through a series of 10 enzymatic reactions. This animation takes a closer look at those reactions and the enzymes that catalyze them.
