Descending Dark is the answer to everything. It's an excellent veto to the Mantis Council putting forward a motion to rough up the knight.<br /><br />A challenge suggested by Relyea (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/V67MO1FCK7M?t=625)">https://youtu.be/V67MO1FCK7M?t=625)</a> to handle all forty plus members of the Mantis Council. Debug mode is used to clone the Mantis Lords (doesn't really work in Godhome).<br /><br />I tried doing this with various states of upgrades but found that even with descending dark and shaman stone you're still going to reach points where you really can't dodge. Going higher than a normal jump had discs spawn higher and going to the ceiling will have descending mantises spawn on you. I noted that occasionally killing a large number of mantises at once with descending dark didn't let me jump up from the discs quickly enough to avoid damage.<br /><br />Not quite a super serious challenge since it's basically spam descending dark and hope they all die before you do but it's quite fun and watching a bunch of mantis lords die at once is very satisfying.
