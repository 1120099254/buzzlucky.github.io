There's nothing like The Residence in commercial air travel. <br /><br />The Residence is above First Class; with a living room, separate bedroom and en-suite shower room, it is the only three-room suite on a commercial airline in the world. It is indeed the World's Premiere Flying Experience.<br /><br />I hadn't flown The Residence in 2 years and I was very keen to re-live this fantastic experience, so I decided to dress up for the occasion. This flight was Etihad's inaugural A380 service from Abu Dhabi to Seoul Incheon.<br /><br />On the return flight from Incheon to Abu Dhabi (next episode), I will be back in Economy to see the differences in travel experience on the same plane.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />Join me for my third, spectacular experience in Etihad Airway’s The Residence! The Residence is completely out of this world within the field of luxury, commercial passenger aviation, far surpassing any first class service that you might care to mention. It is unique in so many ways from providing the only, true double bed in a public, commercial aviation setting within your cabin to the provision of your own personal butler whilst in The Residence lounge and also whilst up in the air, trained in the prestigious Savoy Hotel in London.<br /><br />I take the inaugural flight from Abu Dhabi international airport to Incheon Airport in Seoul, South Korea at the invitation of Etihad Airways, celebrating the launch of this new route in The Residence. I will be making the return journey in economy class in my next video guys, so watch out for that one!<br /><br />If you’d like to see my first and second Residence experiences, you can see these in my videos here: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/1R2sOr6vZqo">https://youtu.be/1R2sOr6vZqo</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Ss1XRl5dcMw">https://youtu.be/Ss1XRl5dcMw</a><br /><br />The Residence flying experience provides a home from home on the ground and then in the sky where any need or desire you could think of is expertly and carefully taken of. The Residence experience starts with being chauffeur driven in a luxury car (typically Audi, BMW or Mercedes) to the first class, VIP terminal of the airport where you are met by your personal luggage carrier, butler and chef.<br /><br />Whilst waiting for your flight, you are housed in your own little palace with access to a spa (I opt to have an extremely relaxing and very nice and pleasant foot massage) and even a smoking room, lavishly decorated and stocked with the finest cigars, including Cuban, from around the world. Your own personal chef is on hand to deliver a Michelin Star level of dining experience, with each dish being hand crafted to your requirements and set in front of you with an explanation of each of the components of the dish before you begin eating. There are a wide variety of premium wines, spirits, beers and champagne to choose from.<br /><br />Within your Residence lounge, there is a large, wall-mounted television and library. The Residence on the ground experience is absolutely sublime and a true masterpiece of comfort and service for the passenger.<br /><br />At the gate to the aeroplane, I am met by the person who is to be my butler in the air. He introduces himself and up in the air, it’s clear that he cares – that’s what’s so great about Etihad Airway’s The Residence – the personal touch. They have researched my background before the day and present me with a number of aviation magazines to read and enjoy on the flight, as well as a framed photo of myself and a certificate to commemorate my travelling on this inaugural flight with Etihad in The Residence.<br /><br />I am extremely impressed with the food I receive on the flight, with a delicious steak and chips being put before me as the main course and delicious little Asian sandwiches with succulent meat as a starter. I am also treated to Bellini Cipriani wine and a wonderful post-dinner digestif of Cellar 28 Remy Martin – greater opulence you couldn’t imagine, honestly!<br /><br />After dinner, I can sprawl out on my double bed and watch TV in private, after taking a very relaxing and refreshing shower in my private bathroom on board. After sleeping, I rub my eyes to see my personal butler bringing a luxurious and mouth-watering breakfast of waffles and raspberries, served with champagne to get me in the mood to face a new day before we land.<br /><br />Overall, I am once again bowled over by Etihad’s provision for me within The Residence class on board and I hold Etihad Airway’s The Residence in the highest regard. Would did you think of the whole fantastic experience? Let me know in the comments – as always, I am very pleased to share these gems of an aviation experience with you, my audience, and I thank you for watching.
