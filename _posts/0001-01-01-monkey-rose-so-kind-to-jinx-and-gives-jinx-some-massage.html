Monkey Rose so kind to Jinx and gives Jinx some massage <br />Dear all beloved subscribers and viewers,<br /><br /><br /><br />How are you? I hope you're doing great.<br /><br />I'd like to share some experiences through this channel that I have been working <br /><br />over three years of filming monkeys and I notice some main points <br /><br />of monkey living like this: <br /><br /> 1.What monkey usually do in the morning:<br /><br /><br /><br />Monkeys are kind of early animals that always get up every early in the morning in order to forage <br /><br />for their kids and themselves and a group of monkeys there is only one leader or alpha (one male and female)<br /><br />to control or lead their group every day.The monkey don't have exact time to get up it depends on the weather in each<br /><br />season but I can say that they might get up at around 5:30-6:30AM. <br /><br /><br /><br /> 2.What monkeys usually do in the afternoon: <br /><br />Monkeys also have lunch like human beings.They generally take a rest after they finish their lunch.<br /><br />Most of  the monkeys take a break on the high trees but some stay on direct ground with their tiny new babies. They're so careful<br /><br />and go up the tree as fast as they hear King or other monkeys make sound to warn that some bad animals such as dogs,cows<br /><br />,elephants or pigs etc. coming towards to where they are. Moms usually suckle their babies on the trees. <br /><br /><br /><br /> 3.What monkeys do in the evening time:<br /><br />After walking to find their food monkeys always listen to their leader inform that it is time to go to sleep<br /><br />so all monkeys walk to the tree where the leader told them that is a safe tree to sleep.The monkeys go to sleep at around<br /><br />6:00-7:00PM it depends on the weather in dry or wet season. At night time the monkeys never sleep on the ground they all sleep on the tree.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In short,The monkeys are tamed animals so sleep and eat very carefully.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks you for your valuable time watching my videos.
