Jupiter's Red Spot, also known as The Great Red Spot. It is a spinning storm on the Jupiter. It is like a hurricane on Earth, but on a much larger scale. This storm is more than 200 miles deep with winds reaching 270 miles per hour.<br /><br /><br /><br />This storm is so big that 2 Earths can fit in it. As per previous reports, Great Red Spot was shrinking and it was starting to disappear. But after observing the latest images and running several computer simulations scientists have found that it's healthy. The strength of it's vortex hasn't changed and it will stay for a long time.<br /><br /><br /><br />SubscribeðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/MrScientific">https://youtube.com/MrScientific</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/MrScientificLive">https://youtube.com/MrScientificLive</a><br /><br /><br /><br />My Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/MrScientific">https://instagram.com/MrScientific</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/ScientificMr">https://facebook.com/ScientificMr</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ScientificMr">https://twitter.com/ScientificMr</a>
