Protein powders (aka protein shakes) are commonly believed to help build muscle. A recent review published in The British Journal of Sports Medicine looked at whether protein supplementation led to improvement in muscle mass and strength.<br /><br />Researchers found that protein supplementation did have a positive effect on strength, muscle size and fat-free mass (aka lean body mass). Improvement in strength was measured using 1-rep max strength. The group that received protein supplementation had an additional benefit of 9% (2.49kg) in their 1 Rep Max when compared to those who didn't consume a protein supplement. Also, the protein group had a 1.4kg gain in fat free mass compared to the control group which had a 1.1kg increase.<br /><br />For professional athletes, every bit of strength counts. This study recommends an upper limit of 2.2g/kg/day of protein intake for serious athletes. But for the rest of us, protein shakes do help a bit, but not as much as getting to the gym and actually doing the work.<br /><br /><br />--<br /><br /><br />Average protein intake in the general population:<br /><br /><br />Many people in high income countries easily exceed the RDA of protein intake without even trying. In the following study from the US, Figure 1C and Table 1 show that the average American adult is consuming somewhere between 1 to 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of ideal body weight, with some variation depending on age group and gender: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/108/2/405/5042716">https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/108/2/405/5042716</a><br />Â <br />--<br /><br />Full Article from British Journal of Sports Medicine: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/6/376">https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/6/376</a><br /><br />Other references for this video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/728005/global-whey-protein-market-size/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/728005/global-whey-protein-market-size/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/protein">https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/protein</a><br />Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology (12ed)<br /><br />#protein #fitness #docunlock<br /><br />Full transcript: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.docunlock.org/youtube/does-protein-powder-work">https://www.docunlock.org/youtube/does-protein-powder-work</a><br /><br />-- <br /><br />Video credits:<br /><br />Certain illustrations adapted from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.svgrepo.com/">https://www.svgrepo.com/</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.freepik.com/">https://www.freepik.com/</a> (pikisuperstar / brgfx / iconicbestiary / Freepik)<br /><br />Music:<br />Intro - Motionarray (affiliate link): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://motionarray.com?ref=ankitgupta1">https://motionarray.com?ref=ankitgupta1</a><br />Overjoyed by Lakey Inspired: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired">https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired</a><br />So Jazzy by Peyruis <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/peyruis">https://soundcloud.com/peyruis</a> Music promoted by Audio Library <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/PcLI7ECCDUA">https://youtu.be/PcLI7ECCDUA</a><br /><br />-- <br /><br />DocUnlock is a new YouTube channel with one purpose: to help people make better decisions about their own health, and the health of their families.
