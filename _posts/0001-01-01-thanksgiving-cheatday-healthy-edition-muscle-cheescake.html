We thought these sounded amazing so we went for Lance Peanut butter gluten free crackers.<br />Smoosh them together while the butter is melting, blend it together and use a a one time foil or a form like the one that I used. <br />Place it in the freezer while you do part 2. <br /><br />Part 2: <br />1 package of non fat Creme Cheese <br />1 egg + 1 egg white <br />3 tbsp of carb master or non fat greek yogurt <br />Mix together <br />Add in 1 scoop of Level 1 Pumpkin Spice Latte protein powder, 1-2 tsp of baking soda, sweetener, any spices of your liking <br />Blend together then add: <br />And 1/2 cup of pumpkin spice puree. <br />Take the crust out of the freezer pour over the mix and place it in the oven. <br /><br />Part 3: <br />If you wanna have the topping that we had ( not a must ): <br />While baking it (depending on oven it can take 30-60 minutes to get ready - just make sure that the mix has gotten stale enough to not move when you gently push the form back and forth) make a Pecan Pie filling - a healthy one! <br /><br />Use 1 egg <br />3 protein scoops (measuring cup) of Maple Syrup <br />Vanilla Powder/extract + Cinnamon <br />Blend it together <br />When the Cake has set take it out place pecans on top and then pour over the blend you just did! <br />Pecans amount free of choice I started with 50 g (added more when I saw that I didnt succeed with what I wanted to see :P when it was done, remember this is the one ingredient that will make the calories rise.) <br /><br />Part 4: <br />put the cake back into the oven again and then when the topping has set - take it out and let it cool down. <br />Place it in your fridge overnight - then ENJOY! <br /><br />Total Calories for the entire cake: <br />Can easily serve 8 people, which makes it 260cal per piece!! <br />1973 calories  <br />P 100g<br />C 128g <br />F 118g <br /><br />üé• IG-profiles: <br />FitCouplefoodies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/fitcouplefoodies_">https://www.instagram.com/fitcouplefoodies_</a>   <br />Henke: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sundvallll">https://www.instagram.com/sundvallll</a>  <br />Ida: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/idabergfoth">https://www.instagram.com/idabergfoth</a>  <br /><br /><br />The rehab gun (massage gun we use)  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rehabgun.com/">https://rehabgun.com/</a> <br />Use IDA15 will give you 15% off on it.
