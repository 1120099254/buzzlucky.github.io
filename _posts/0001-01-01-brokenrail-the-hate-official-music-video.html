Official video for BrokenRail's brand new single 'THE HATE'. An entire world was thrown into a midst of chaos, panic, fear, financial instability, &amp; social unrest stemming from a virus keeping the entire human population under lockdown. COVID-19 alongside everything else 2020 has brought upon us has fueled the fires and fanned the flames of hatred across our Earth. United we are strong, divided we fall. This is 'THE HATE&quot;.<br /><br />LYRICS:<br />It feels if the ground’s falling right where I stand<br />The world I once knew now a nightmare instead<br />No trust in each other divided we can’t<br />This life without love only leaves us with pain<br /><br />I feel, this world, is falling down on me<br /><br />A monster deep inside<br />The fire in your eyes<br />As the hope begins to die<br />Well it feeds the hate inside<br /><br />Locked in this prison alone with my mind<br />No end set in sight yet they say we’ll be fine<br />A darkness is spreading we’re all out of time<br />Left with no choice come together or die<br /><br />Distaste floods my body I can’t even breathe<br />The weight pressing down as this life crushes me<br /><br />A monster deep inside<br />The fire in your eyes<br />As the hope begins to die<br />Well it feeds the hate inside<br /><br />I feel, this world, is falling down on me<br /><br />A monster deep inside<br />The fire in your eyes<br />As the hope begins to die<br />Well it feeds the hate inside
