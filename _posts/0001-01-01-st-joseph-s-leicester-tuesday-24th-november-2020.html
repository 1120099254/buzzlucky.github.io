WELCOME to St Joseph's, Leicester, for our celebration of mass. Fr John has begun to resume his streamed mass, having been unwell and in hospital for several weeks.  He is starting cautiously, celebrating mass on Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10.30 am on each of those days, with the plan to resume daily mass when he is stronger.<br /><br />All music used in this streamed recording is used under license and with permission.
