A car won’t start, but then just revs to life! A broken doorbell suddenly starts ringing again. How does that happen? Fixies, those tiny human like creatures that secretly keep all of our appliances and gadgets running smoothly!<br /><br /><br /><br />“The Fixies” follows the comical misadventures of Tom Thomas and his secret friendship with Simka and Nolik, the children of the Fixie family that lives in his apartment. There’s just no end to the troubles Tom Thomas and his Fixie friends get themselves into with all the gadgets and appliances around them! Luckily for Tom Thomas, the Fixies have the smarts, skills, and tools they need to figure out a problem and solve it before his parents find out.
