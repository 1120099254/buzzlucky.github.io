Or perhaps you are the owner of a more<br />unique type of car than the usual basic ones we see? Whatever it is spotting unusual cars<br />driving by can spark nostalgia or even pique ones curiosity. Join us as today we will be taking<br />a look at the 10 most unusual cars in the world.<br />10) Streamline cars R-100<br />Sir Dennistoun Burney wanted to adapt his experience in aviation to automobiles. His intention<br />was to mimic the aerodynamic design of airships onto car bodies. However, he never intended<br />to start a car production company, he just wanted to design the streamlined car bodies. But<br />nevertheless Streamline Cars Ltd was founded. He took many design elements of planes like<br />flexible cables, independent suspension of all four wheels and hydraulic breaks, and applied<br />them to his cars. But most of all he wanted a streamlined car body. Compared to the standard<br />cars back this vehicle was revolutionary. The aerodynamic design had no protruding parts.<br />Both headlights were beautifully integrated into the car body. Due to the fact that he planned<br />the front design as flat and aerodynamically as possible a front-engine-design was not<br />possible. The engine was placed in the rear of the car. Only 25 copies of the car were<br />produced until the production came to a screeching halt.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riz60Ir-5TQ&amp;amp;feature=emb_title&amp;amp;ab_channel=BritishPath%C3%A9">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riz60Ir-5TQ&amp;amp;feature=emb_title&amp;amp;ab_channel=BritishPath%C3%A9</a><br />9) 1936 Stout Scarab<br />Before other name brand minivans began dominating the minivan market, there was the Stout<br />Scarab. First created in the 1930s, believe it or not, it is considered as the first minivan in the<br />world. Designer William Stout, who had a background in aircraft engineering, excelled at<br />combining luxury and leisure into transportation, and the Scarab is just an example of that.<br />Think of it as a diner on wheels, it was not a very big car but despite that it was fitted with a V8<br />engine to boot. Sadly the brand wasn&amp;#39;t a success because of the price tag. Few people were<br />willing to pay for the innovation, it cost $5,000 back then to own, which is around $90,000<br />today and cost even more than the luxurious Chrysler Imperials of that age. Only 9 examples<br />of this minivan were built and only 5 still exist at present day.<br />8) General motors’ Firebird<br />General Motors built quite a few weird and wonderful cars just to show what they were capable<br />of in terms of method and creativity, in other words the Firebirds. These were inspired by the<br />designs of fighter aircrafts. One thing is for sure, they sure deserve an award for coming up<br />with such a cool name, but these cars owe more to their design to jet planes than to birds.<br />They were sleek and streamlined and four Firebirds were designed and built over the years.<br />Some of their more unusual features were their bubble topped canopies, the tail fins and short<br />wings, and the steering being controlled by a joystick positioned between the two seats. This<br />was supposed to give the car a futuristic feel and instill the experience of flying a plane. The<br />cars were powered by the same big gas turbine engines which also powered fighter jets. As a<br />result they were very unstable due to the high power so it was difficult to test them. <br /><br />7) Peel P50<br />The Peel P50 is a world record breaker. It was even listed in the 2010 Guinness Book of World<br />Records as the smallest car ever made. This three-wheeled micro car was originally made by<br />the Peel Engineering Company for only three years. It was advertised as being the perfect size<br />to fit one adult and one shopping bag. No room for anyone else in this tiny car! It only has one<br />door, which is on the left-hand side, and one headlight. Going backwards in the Peel P50 was<br />not an easy option as the car had no reverse gear and needed to be maneuvered backwards<br />physically using a handle at the car’s rear. Only 50 of these odd little cars were ever made and<br />only 27 are still known to be in existence.<br />6) Ferrari 512S Modulo<br />At first glance, you would be forgiven for thinking that the Ferrari 512S Modulo looks more like<br />a spaceship than a car. This was a car developed to go as fast as possible and so has quite<br />an unusual design to make it that way. It comes with an extremely low, wedge-shaped body,<br />less than a metre high, in order to be as aerodynamic as possible and also has a canopy-style<br />glass roof which slides forward to allow the driver to enter the cabin of the car.
