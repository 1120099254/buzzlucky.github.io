From the movie &quot;Airheads&quot;...<br /><br />:: Born to Raise Hell ::<br /><br />Listen up here, I'll make it quite clear<br />I'm gonna put some boogie in your ear<br />Shake and bop, don't you stop<br />Dance like a maniac until you drop<br />I don't mind, I don't mind<br />I can run a razor right up your spine<br />What are you waiting for<br />What do you think you were created for<br /><br />Show us you care, show us you dare<br />You don't know what happened, not if you weren't there<br /><br />Born to raise hell, born to raise hell<br />We know to do it and we do it real well<br />Born to raise hell, born to raise hell<br />Voodoo medicine, cast my spell<br />Born to raise hell, born to raise hell<br />Play that guitar just like ringin' a bell<br />Take it or leave it<br /><br />Going for broke, rock till you choke<br />It don't matter if you drink or smoke<br />Speak through the beat, get up on your feet<br />Sweating like a hound dog, white as a sheet<br /><br />Don't you be scared, don't you be scared<br />Everybody terrified, I don't seem fair<br />What are you waiting for<br />What do you think you were created for<br /><br />Out of your seat, blind in the heat<br />Do the nasty boogie mama, stomp your feet
