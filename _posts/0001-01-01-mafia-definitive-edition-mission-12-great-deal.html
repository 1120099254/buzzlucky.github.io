Thanks 2K Games for giving me early access to Mafia Definitive Edition!  <br /><br /><br />Mafia: Definitive Edition is an upcoming action-adventure video game developed by Hangar 13 and published by 2K Games. A remake of the 2002 video game Mafia, it was announced in May 2020 and is scheduled for release in September 2020 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game is set within a redesigned version of the fictional city of Lost Heaven (based on Chicago) in the 1930s, and follows the rise and fall of taxi driver-turned-mobster Tommy Angelo within the Salieri crime family.<br /><br />Conceived as a full remake of the original, Mafia: Definitive Edition was built from the ground up with new assets and an expanded story, although missions and arcs from the original game are carried over. As with the 2002 game, players control Tommy Angelo throughout the game's single-player campaign, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. New to the remake is the introduction of motorcycles, a first in the series. Mafia: Definitive Edition's gameplay mechanics are based on those of Mafia III. A 'Classic Difficulty' setting will also be included.<br /><br />In 1930, after being strong-armed into helping two members of the Salieri family - Paulie and Sam - escape an ambush by the rival Morello family, impoverished taxi driver Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Angelo is assaulted by members of the Morello family in an act of revenge. While he is rescued by the Salieri family after calling in a favor Don Ennio Salieri promised him, Tommy loses his job after his employers learn about his involvement with the Mafia. With a lack of job opportunities due to the ongoing Great Depression, Tommy is forced to accept Salieri's offer to join his organization, and soon befriends Paulie and Sam as they complete various jobs together.<br /><br /><br /><br />ABOUT THIS CHANNEL<br /><br />This channel is in no way associated with 2K Games or Hangar 13 Games.<br />Mafia Game Videos is a fan channel dedicated to bringing you the latest news, guides and videos from the Mafia video game series.<br /><br /><br />#Mafia1 #MafiaTrilogy #MafiaDefinitiveEdition
