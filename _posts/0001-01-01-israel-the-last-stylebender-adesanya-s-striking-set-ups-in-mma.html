In the first video of this mini-series, I will explain and breakdown the striking framework of Israel Adesanya for MMA (vs. Orthodox Opponents). This will hopefully help those who are interested in understanding the style of The Last Stylebender.<br /><br />As Israel Adesanya is a methodic fighter, this video will also be very methodic, let's look at set ups and patterns rather than focusing on highlights.<br />___<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mmadegree/">https://www.instagram.com/mmadegree/</a>
