Tangadan falls is one of the most sought-after waterfalls in La Union. Yet getting here was not a walk in the park: From San Gabriel's municipal hall, one must ride a &quot;habal-habal&quot;<br />(motorcycle) or a monster jeepney that  goes through the winding roads for quite a few kilometers.  After the wearying ride comes another trek that lasts about thirty minutes. Nevertheless, once you hear the rushing water, all the struggles will just melt away, for a marvelous  sight will be in front of your eyes. <br /><br />Tangadan is a two-tier cascade along Baroro River with cold water emerging from the wilderness of the province alongside the Cordillera Mountain Range. It is a noteworthy cliff diving site (towering around 50 feet) amongst the adventurous souls, an ideal site for nature enthusiasts and an idyllic spot for surfers who wants to take a break from chasing the waves.<br /><br />Special thanks to our local guide Mr. Reymond Nebres. He is an accredited tour/eco guide of Tangadan Falls certified by Department of Tourism.<br /><br />Background Music:<br /><br />Tribal War Council - Doug Maxwell, Media Right Productions <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FvhV1XJ06dc">https://youtu.be/FvhV1XJ06dc</a><br /><br />Cinematic Epic Trailer Music by Infraction [No Copyright Music]<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYWYFETRsyA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYWYFETRsyA</a>
