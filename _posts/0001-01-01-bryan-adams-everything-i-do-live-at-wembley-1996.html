The show opened with the album’s first hit single “The Only Thing That Looks Good On Me Is You” and straight away the stage was set for an energetic, hit packed performance which was received with wild enthusiasm by the huge crowd. This is a legendary show for Bryan Adams fans and is now finally being released on ALL FORMATS for the first time.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vevo.ly/90XoHC">http://vevo.ly/90XoHC</a><br />Best of Bryan Adams: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ZevZ9f">https://goo.gl/ZevZ9f</a><br />Subscribe here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/wTdSXo">https://goo.gl/wTdSXo</a><br /><br />#BryanAdams #EverythingIDo #Vevo #Rock #Live
