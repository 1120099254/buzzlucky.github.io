Fallchirmjaeger and the Free French clash over a mountain ridge during a blizzard. In this video, I'm playing as the Germans and fellow CM Youtuber DoubleVision is played as the French.<br /><br />DoubleVision's video is here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Hg7BheZoY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Hg7BheZoY</a><br />and make sure to check out his channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHKj8scdny0fz-qrCwW2yw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoHKj8scdny0fz-qrCwW2yw</a><br /><br />This is a mirror battle, so we've played both sides: the game where I command the French and Doublevision commands the Germans is coming soon in turn-by-turn format.<br /><br />This is Combat Mission: Fortress Italy, set on the Italian Front from July 1943 to May 1945. Mods-wise I'm running the ubiquitous HQS sound mod, Vin's Geometric icons and Vein's effects.<br /><br />Combat Mission is a game developed by Battlefront.com. One of the most realistic tactical simulations ever made, Combat Mission covers a wide variety of military settings, from World War 2 (Normandy, Market Garden, Sicily, Italy and the Eastern Front) to fictional modern conflicts in Syria (Shock Force) and Ukraine (Black Sea).
