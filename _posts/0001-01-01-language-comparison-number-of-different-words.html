We compare some of the most popular languages in the world, what are the odds and probability of speaking certain language, which language has the most alphabets. Which language has the most words? How many words does English, Spanish, Arabic or Hindi have? What is the most difficult language to learn? What are the major languages of the world? We visualize the animated scale of alphabets, characters and words. <br /><br />Disclaimer: <br />Only words of languages with over 20 million speakers are included otherwise the video would get too long. The only exceptions are the top 5. Thus apologies if your language is not included.  <br />Only Alphabets with a usage of above 50 million, according to World Atlas, are included, with some exceptions. Video makes no distinction between speech, dialect and literacy. <br />Number referenced for words tend to be the largest dictionary that can be found online. Dictionary referenced in video. There may be bigger dictionaries though. <br />Usage or number of words may be outdated, but are often after 2010. More info in references. <br />There is difficulty researching between different formal definition of letters, diacritics and circumflexes, whichever probability and number given for the Alphabets are stated in the sources. There may be unintentional mistake, kindly comment if spotted. <br /><br />Sources and References: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/Ahx6TT0B">https://pastebin.com/Ahx6TT0B</a> <br /><br />Music: Adventure by Alexander Nakarada (www.serpentsoundstudios.com)<br />Licensed under Creative Commons BY Attribution 4.0 License<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br /><br />List of Languages and Words featured: <br />Arabic, Azerbaijani, Bengali, Chinese, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Javanese, Korean, Latin, Malay, Marathi, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese. <br /><br />List of Alphabets and Scripts featured: <br />Arabic Alphabet, Armenian Alphabet, Bengali Alphabet, Burmese Alphabet, Chinese Characters, Cyrillic Alphabet, Danish Alphabet, Devanagari Alphabet, Dutch Alphabet, Filipino Alphabet, Finnish Alphabet, French Alphabet, German Alphabet, Greek Alphabet, Hebrew Alphabet, Hungarian Alphabet, Icelandic Alphabet, Italian Alphabet, Japanese Kana, Japanese Kanji, Kangxi Radicals, Khmer Alphabet, Hangul Alphabet, Kurdish Alphabet, Latin Alphabet, Lithuanian Alphabet, Polish Alphabet, Portuguese Alphabet, Spanish Alphabet, Swedish Alphabet, Tamil Alphabet, Telugu Alphabet, Thai Alphabet,Turkish Alphabet, Vietnamese Alphabet, Welsh Alphabet.
