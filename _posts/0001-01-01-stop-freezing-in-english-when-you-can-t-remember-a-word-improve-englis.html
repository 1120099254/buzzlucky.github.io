5 methods to improve your English conversation skills by learning to stop blocking or freezing when you can't remember a word. This lesson will help you enjoy more fluent English conversations.

I have launched my British English (Modern RP) pronunciation course! I’ll train you to read phonetic transcriptions, and produce each sound that comprises modern received pronunciation. I’ll also teach you how to implement the correct use of intonation, stress, rhythm, connected speech, and much more. We’ll compare similar sounds, and look at tricky topics like the glottal stop and the dark L. I've worked on this for YEARS and I am so happy to finally let you take the course!<br /><br />Technically, I need to mark this as an AD even though it is my own company so - AD :)<br /><br />Christina from 'Speak English with Christina' inspired me to make this video.
