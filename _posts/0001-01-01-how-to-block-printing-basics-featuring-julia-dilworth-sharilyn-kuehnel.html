We invited 24hrs Vancouver DIY columnist Julia Dilworth and printmaker Sharilyn Kuehnel to Opus Downtown Vancouver to demonstrate the basics of block printing. Explore these steps as Sharilyn teaches Julia how to transfer an image onto Safety-Kut Block, carve an image using Speedball Lino Cutter and Bench Hook, and print on both Strathmore Creative Cards and t-shirts with Gamblin Relief Inks. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.opusartsupplies.com/blockprintingbasics">http://www.opusartsupplies.com/blockprintingbasics</a><br /><br />-<br /><br />The versatility of printmaking makes this DIY project perfect for home and for creating multiple prints. The blocks can also be used on fine art paper to create a print ready to be framed and enjoyed on the walls of your own home or to give as a gift!<br /><br />Experience the block printing process for yourself by watching Block Printing Basic above or read the full exclusive article at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.opusartsupplies.com/blockprintingbasics">http://www.opusartsupplies.com/blockprintingbasics</a><br /><br />For more DIY projects, follow Julia every Thursday in the Vancouver 24hrs newspaper or online at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vancouver.24hrs.ca/author/julia-dilworth">http://vancouver.24hrs.ca/author/julia-dilworth</a><br /><br />Get even more creative printmaking ideas from Sharilyn's blog at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.weekdays-from-scratch.blogspot.ca/search/label/printmaking">http://www.weekdays-from-scratch.blogspot.ca/search/label/printmaking</a><br /><br />-<br /><br />Credits<br /><br />Presented by<br /><br />Julia Dilworth<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vancouver.24hrs.ca/author/julia-dilworth">http://vancouver.24hrs.ca/author/julia-dilworth</a><br /><br />Sharilyn Kuehnel<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.weekdays-from-scratch.blogspot.ca/">http://www.weekdays-from-scratch.blogspot.ca/</a><br /><br />Produced by<br />Opus Art Supplies<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://opusartsupplies.com/">http://opusartsupplies.com/</a><br /><br />Created by<br />Ryan Mund<br /><br />Music by<br />Dan O'Connor<br />&quot;Imagine Magneta&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.danosongs.com/">http://www.danosongs.com/</a><br />Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a>
