Kia Ora, I'm David Chaston and this is ninety at nine, brought to you by interest.co.nz. This is where you get everyting you need to know in ninety seconds at nine oclock with news that trade seems to be rising, and driven by an expanding Chinese economy.<br /><br />China has posted an enormous trade surplus in November. It hit a record +US$75 bln, compared with a US$58 bln in October and analysts has expected a +US$53 bln surplus. Their exports were up an impressive +21% in November compared with the same month a year ago, and their imports were up +4.5%.<br /><br />The politically sensitive surplus with the US was up to +US$37.3 bln and representing half the overall result. <br /><br />China ran a -US$412 mln deficit with New Zealand in the month. And with Australia, their's was a -US$3.8 bln deficit with imports from Australia falling -4.9%.<br /><br />Chinaâ€™s foreign exchange reserves rose by more than +US$50 bln in November to the highest since August 2016, boosted by the weaker greenback, and that trade surplus at record highs. They now stand at +US$3.2 tln or about 20% of China's GDP. <br /><br />Taiwan's trade surplus didn't grow like China's, but the country also posted a very good year-on-year rise in exports (+12%), and this was almost matched by an equal rise in imports (+10%).<br /><br />Aircargo volumes are rising as well. In fact cargoes into North America are now higher than for the same November month a year ago. Domestic aircargo there is up even more strongly. And while they are still well behind year-ago levels, aircargo volumes in the Asia Pacific region are on the upswing. <br /><br />In Australia, S&amp;P has downgraded the credit ratings for the states of NSW and Victoria, dropping them both from AAA status to AA+. That aligns them with both Western Australia and Queensland, and ahead of South Australia's AA rating.<br /><br />In Europe, the final Brexit talks are underway and there is not an air of optimism surrounding them, even as the UK has backed down on its threat to rip up some key prior agreements. It is the eleventh hour and still no substantial blinking by either side.<br /><br />The UST 10yr yield will start today softer at 0.93% and a -4 bps reversal. <br /><br />The price of gold is up solidly today, gaining +US$27 to US$1865/oz or +1.5%.<br /><br />Oil prices are unchanged at US$46/bbl in the US, while the international price is still just on US$49/bbl.<br /><br />And the Kiwi dollar has firmed marginally to 70.6 USc and off its recent highs but at a similar level to a week ago. Against the Australian dollar we have weakened slightly, back to 94.8 AUc. Against the euro we are unchanged at 58.2 euro cents. That means our TWI-5 is still at 72.6.<br /><br />I'm David Chaston and that was 90 @ 9 brought to you by interest.co.nz
