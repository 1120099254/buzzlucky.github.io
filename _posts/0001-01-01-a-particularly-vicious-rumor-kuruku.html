Track six off the album APVR, my personal favorite. <br /><br />Lyrics in the description:<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Go Go Go&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh my,<br /><br />Oh me,<br /><br />Oh I can't tell,<br /><br />I can't tell whats happening.<br /><br /><br /><br />But it feels like,<br /><br />I may be getting shorter,<br /><br />At least I know,<br /><br />That the distance between me and the floor is shrinking.<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh now I see,<br /><br />Oh me I'm unraveling,<br /><br />Ever so slowly,<br /><br />But there ain't a thing that you can do about my condition<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm unraveling,<br /><br />Slowly, slowly,<br /><br />Slowly, slowly,<br /><br />Slowly, slowly.<br /><br /><br /><br />Kuruku,<br /><br />Won't you please dance with me,<br /><br />Oh I could,<br /><br />Be romanced by anything,<br /><br />But I promise,<br /><br />I'll be so, so still,<br /><br />once you put me back inside the wall,<br /><br />Because rag dolls,<br /><br />They don't say much,<br /><br />They don't say anything at all.<br /><br /><br /><br />And now,<br /><br />Now that I'm, just a string,<br /><br />Well all my dreams,<br /><br />All my dreams have changed.<br /><br /><br /><br />And I find myself waiting,<br /><br />I'm waiting for my big balloon,<br /><br />Won't you come and find me,<br /><br />Cause I want to go off floating, floating,<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh can't you see,<br /><br />Oh me I'm unraveling,<br /><br />For surely strings,<br /><br />Strings don't dream a thing.<br /><br /><br /><br />But your just gonna have to watch me,<br /><br />Cause there ain't a thing that you can do about my condition,<br /><br />Cause its mine,<br /><br />Its mine, its my condition,<br /><br />Its mine, its my condition,<br /><br />Its mine, its my condition,<br /><br />Its mine, its mine,<br /><br />Its my condition.<br /><br /><br /><br />Kuruku<br /><br />Won't you please dance with me,<br /><br />Oh I could,<br /><br />Be romanced by anything,<br /><br />But I promise,<br /><br />I'll be so, so still,<br /><br />Once you put me back inside the wall,<br /><br />Rag dolls, they don't say much they don't say anything,<br /><br />At all.<br /><br /><br /><br />No no no,<br /><br /><br /><br />No rag dolls,<br /><br />They don't say much,<br /><br /><br /><br />No rag dolls,<br /><br />They don't say much,<br /><br /><br /><br />No rag dolls,<br /><br />They don't say much they don't say anything at all.
