Take time to realize<br /><br />That your warmth is<br /><br />Crashing down on in<br /><br /><br /><br />Take time to realize<br /><br />That I am on your side<br /><br />Didn't I, didn't I tell you<br /><br /><br /><br />But I can't spell it out for you<br /><br />You know it's never gonna be that simple<br /><br />Though I can't spell it out for you<br /><br /><br /><br />If you just realize what I just realized<br /><br />Then we'd be perfect for each other<br /><br />And we'll never find another<br /><br />Just realize what I just realized<br /><br />We'd never have to wonder if we missed out on each other now<br /><br /><br /><br />Take time to realize<br /><br />Oh-oh I'm on your side<br /><br />Didn't I, didn't I tell you<br /><br /><br /><br />Take time to realize<br /><br />Oh-oh I'm on your side<br /><br />Oh<br /><br /><br /><br />But I can't spell it out for you<br /><br />You know it's never gonna be that simple<br /><br />Though I can't spell it out for you<br /><br /><br /><br />If you just realize what I just realized<br /><br />Then we'd be perfect for each other<br /><br />And we'll never find another<br /><br />Just realize what I just realized<br /><br />We'd never have to wonder if we missed out on each other now<br /><br /><br /><br />It's not the same<br /><br />No it's nver the same<br /><br />If you don't feel it too<br /><br />If you meet me halfway<br /><br />If you would meet me halfway<br /><br />It could be the same for you<br /><br /><br /><br />If you just realize what I just realized<br /><br />Then we'd be perfect for each other<br /><br />And we'll never find another<br /><br />Just realize what I just realized<br /><br />We'd never have to wonder if we missed out on each other<br /><br /><br /><br />Just realize what I just realized<br /><br />We'd never have to wonder if we missed out on each other now<br /><br /><br /><br />we missed out on each other now...<br /><br /><br /><br />realize...
