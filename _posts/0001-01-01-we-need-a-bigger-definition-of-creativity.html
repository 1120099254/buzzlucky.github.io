In other words, you might think of people who make things. <br /><br />I think it’s what we mean when we use a label like “creative type.” But there is no such thing as a creative type. We are all creative. Every one of us. We just need a bigger definition of creativity.  <br /><br />Yes, creativity involves making things. But it can also mean mashing up ideas in innovative ways. It can mean geeking out on data and finding unique solutions to practical problems. It can mean hacking systems and tweaking things in unusual ways. It can mean exploring ideas and navigating information until you become an expert curator. <br /><br />It can mean designing systems that empower the creative work of others. It can mean creating change in the world by speaking truth and leading movements and interacting with people.  <br />See, each of these creative approaches shape our world in profound ways. <br /><br />And the more we see the creativity all around us, the more we are able to appreciate the creativity inside of ourselves.
