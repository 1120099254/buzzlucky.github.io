Don’t sweat too much over whether the list is right, real or seems impossible to achieve.  <br /><br />Once you have the list, go through each item one by one and ask yourself one of the two questions<br /><br />1. “How badly you want that thing? Does, not having it make you seriously uncomfortable? That life for you and your family will be insecure, not adequately provided for? That you would find yourself wanting in the roles you play in your life?” If the answer is yes, then retain it in your list and mark it as your Security Bucket, e.g. a large corpus of money when you retire; don’t worry yet about how large<br /><br />2. For some things on your list ask, “Will doing this or having this will give me the greatest joys and not doing it or having it will be my deepest personal regrets. Again, if the answer is yes, this stays in your list, e.g. starting my own restaurant or so and giving it my best shot. These items form your Growth Bucket <br /><br />Do this exercise in earnest, and find at least a few things that you must simply have and do in your life. The stronger the image of these things in your mind the better you set yourself up for successful investing, because now you have motivation to do what it takes. And, you are going to need this motivation. So, the first thing you need to do to set yourself up for success in and through investing, is knowing why you are doing it, you long term goals, the stuff that makes your life well lived and worthwhile for you.<br /><br />Know more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.moneyworks4me.com/">https://www.moneyworks4me.com/</a> <br /><br />List of Mutual Funds India: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2qUEvF3">https://bit.ly/2qUEvF3</a>
