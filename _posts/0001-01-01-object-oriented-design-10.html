Code from Video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/YIxfI">http://goo.gl/YIxfI</a><br /><br />In this tutorial, I cover GRASP, or General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns. GRASP defines rules you can use to decide which objects should have which responsibilities in your Object design.<br /><br />Here I cover the following rules: Creator, Expert, Coupling, Controller and High Cohesion. The tutorial includes a presentation, code examples, sequence diagrams and class diagrams to make everything understandable and interesting. The code used is available in the link above
