Social distraction and life. In a reality that's flooded with fake news, identities and false realities, design ethicist James Williams argues that we need to redefine the way we use social media if we want to be more, well, social. James Williams is a design ethicist and a co-founder of the Time Well Spent campaign, an effort that aims to evolve the design ethos of digital technologies to help them be more respectful of our time and attention, and more supportive of our deeper human values and goals. He is currently completing doctoral research at the University of Oxford, where he is focused on questions of attention and persuasion in technology design. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
