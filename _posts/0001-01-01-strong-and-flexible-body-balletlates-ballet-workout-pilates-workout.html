Follow this months Workout calendar - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/CalendarWorkout">http://bit.ly/CalendarWorkout</a><br /><br />Check out lots of Stuff we LOVE and Use - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/StuffWELOVE">http://bit.ly/StuffWELOVE</a><br /><br />This full body program will help you open your body, become stronger, more flexible and help you get long slim muscles.<br /><br />The strong and flexible series is inspired by my recent ballet classes, and I wanted to add some flexibility improving routines to my channel. You can do these videos individually or as a part of my monthly calendar, to make sure, you are both working on mobilising and keeping the muscle balance around the joints.
