In my experience, you will have a much better chance of selling your product or service to a customer if they know you and are primed BEFORE you make your sales call.<br /><br />If you can hone your client relationship building skills and establish rapport with your customers before you make the sale, you will have a very high chance of success because they will already be excited about you and your product. And if not, you will at least know enough about them to determine whether or not they are serious enough to be worth your while.<br /><br />However, knowing how to approach potential clients is only the first part of making a sale. The second part requires knowing how to make an effective sales call. <br /><br />To make an effective sales call, make sure that you´re having a conversation. If you read from a script, your words will most likely sound formulaic. To have a real conversation, get to know your customer. Spend a good 20-30 minutes just asking them about what their problem is, how they´ve tried to solve it in the past, and why they want it solved. Then explain how your framework can help them.<br /><br />Sometimes, potential clients are afraid to make an investment. Rather than trying to overcome their objection, figure out what they´re really afraid of. Failing? Not getting results? This will help you determine if you can move forward with them.<br /><br />Your client relationship building skills will be essential to finding new clients. But once you learn how to approach potential clients, learning to make confident sales calls will help you cement those relationships and fill your business with paying customers.
