Couldn't find a way to watch this outside of the US (it's on Kanopy if you're over there), figured it might be a good intro to James Baldwin for people who haven't the attention spans to read anything longer than a tweet (i.e. people like me...). That being said, The Fire Next Time is like 50 pages long so give it a shot!<br /><br />NOTE: each part begins with a frozen shot ~5 seconds, youtube kept rejecting my clipped videos so I had to use some encoding settings I'm not super familiar with. Happy to upload the full length version if I can get the verification. Sorry about the inconvenience, otherwise everything should be okay RE: audio syncing and whatnot.
