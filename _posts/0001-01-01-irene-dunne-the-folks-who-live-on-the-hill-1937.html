Arguably, the sweetest musical film moment of all time. After losing 400 uploads from my channel in May this year, I am still gradually putting some back. Here is a very rare film clip from &quot;High, Wide, and Handsome&quot;, which took me many years to find. The lyrics are at the end of these notes. Irene's co-stars are Charles Bickford and Randolph Scott. How sweet is Randolph here? <br /><br />There is a very slight loss in quality from my original upload. Do understand that the actual film has never been available on DVD or VHS. What you see here - or saw on my original upload - is about as good as it will get. My source came from the USA and must have been taped from TV. Turn your speaker volume up slightly.<br /><br />To see Irene looking so lovely, and singing so beautifully is an absolute joy ... enjoy.<br /><br />Lyrics; by Jerome Kern/Oscar Hammerstein II <br />Many men with lofty aims,<br />Strive for lofty goals,<br />Others play at smaller games,<br />Being simpler souls. <br /><br />I am of the latter brand;<br />All I want to do,<br />Is to find a spot of land,<br />And live there with you. <br /><br />Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high,<br />You and I,<br />Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill.<br />And we'll be pleased to be called,<br />&quot;The folks who live on the hill&quot;. <br /><br />Someday we may be adding a thing or two,<br />A wing or two.<br />We will make changes as any fam'ly will,<br />But we will always be called,<br />&quot;The folks who live on the hill&quot;. <br /><br />Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,<br />The sort of view that seems to want to be seen.<br />And when the kids grow up and leave us,<br />We'll sit and look at the same old view,<br />Just we two. <br /><br />Darby and Joan who used to be Jack and Jill,<br />The folks like to be called,<br />What they have always been called,<br />&quot;The folks who live on the hill&quot;.
