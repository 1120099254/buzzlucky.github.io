Because it is readily available in the natural landscape, humans have been building with clay for as long as we’ve been creating structures.  <br /><br />There are countless examples of historical clay-based buildings, including the Pueblo adobe construction of native New Mexicans to the portable wood frame structures constructed by Australian aboriginal people, which were insulated with clay to protect the inhabitants from both cold and heat. Even on an individual level, a young person’s first attempt at building a structure usually takes the shape of a dirt-and-water amalgam, whether in the form of a backyard mud wall or a moated sandcastle built on a family trip to the beach.  <br /><br />Around the world for centuries, humans have been creating structures out of the most readily available materials: earth and water. But why do some of these structures—like the ancient fort at Hierakonpolis—survive, while others have long since turned to dust? <br />---<br />Trusted by over 1.9 million builders in more than 130 countries, Bluebeam's smart, intuitive solutions advance the way architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) professionals work, manage and collaborate on projects digitally. <br /><br />For more from Bluebeam, follow us:<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/bluebeam">https://twitter.com/bluebeam</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bluebeam/">https://www.facebook.com/bluebeam/</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/blue...">https://www.linkedin.com/company/blue...</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bluebeam_inc/">https://www.instagram.com/bluebeam_inc/</a><br />Built, the Bluebeam Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.bluebeam.com/">https://blog.bluebeam.com/</a>
