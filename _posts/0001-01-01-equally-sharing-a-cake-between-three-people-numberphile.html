Bob's trimmed piece still carries the status of his &quot;first choice&quot;, so if Charlie leaves it, Bob will (must) pick it... otherwise he'll pick the one that was his original &quot;second choice&quot;... The upshot of this is that there's no chance Alice will be left with the trimmed piece after everyone takes their first piece. And Bob remains envy free under these conditions too.<br /><br />A trilogy of mathematical cake cutting videos... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/CakeCuttingTrilogy">http://bit.ly/CakeCuttingTrilogy</a><br /><br />Editing and animation in this video by Pete McPartlan<br /><br />Discuss this video on Brady's subreddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://redd.it/72jyww">https://redd.it/72jyww</a><br /><br />Numberphile is supported by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/MSRINumberphile">http://bit.ly/MSRINumberphile</a><br /><br />We are also supported by Science Sandbox, a Simons Foundation initiative dedicated to engaging everyone with the process of science.<br /><br />NUMBERPHILE<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.numberphile.com/">http://www.numberphile.com/</a><br />Numberphile on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/numberphile">http://www.facebook.com/numberphile</a><br />Numberphile tweets: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/numberphile">https://twitter.com/numberphile</a><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Numberphile_Sub">http://bit.ly/Numberphile_Sub</a><br /><br />Videos by Brady Haran<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/numberphile">http://www.patreon.com/numberphile</a><br /><br />Brady's videos subreddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/BradyHaran/">http://www.reddit.com/r/BradyHaran/</a><br /><br />Brady's latest videos across all channels: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bradyharanblog.com/">http://www.bradyharanblog.com/</a><br /><br />Sign up for (occasional) emails: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/YdjL9">http://eepurl.com/YdjL9</a>
