We do<br /><br />Is all creation groaning? It is<br />Is a new creation coming? It is<br />Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst? It is<br />Is it good that we remind ourselves of this? It is<br /><br />Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?<br />Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?<br />The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave<br />He is David’s Root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave<br />Is He worthy? Is He worthy?<br />Of all blessing and honor and glory?<br />Is He worthy of this? He is<br /><br />Does the Father truly love us? He does<br />Does the Spirit move among us? He does<br />And does Jesus our Messiah hold forever those He loves? He does<br />Does our God intend to dwell again with us? He does<br /><br />Is anyone worthy?
