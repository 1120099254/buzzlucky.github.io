&quot;Sensitive--The Untold Story&quot; examines in depth the temperament trait of high sensitivity. It is based on the findings of bestselling author-psychologist Dr. Elaine Aron and features Alanis Morissette. Dr. Aron's international bestseller &quot;The Highly Sensitive Person&quot; has been translated into 22 languages and her research is published in top-tier peer reviewed journals such as The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology and Brain and Behavior, as well as replicated and extended by other scientists, who are interviewed in the film. Dr. Aron found that not only 1 in 5 people are highly sensitive, but the trait occurs in the same percentage in over 100 other species.<br /><br />Watch Sensitive-The Untold Story documentary now! www.sensitivethemovie.com
