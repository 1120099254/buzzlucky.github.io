These viral vloggers are much more savvy about digital marketing than all their cash-for-clicks selfies may suggest. Still, they must evolve from the influencer stew from whence they spawned, or risk extinction. From Jake Paul to Lilly Singh, these social media stars need to realize they aren't famous anymore.<br /><br />In 2012, Cameron Dallas was a star on the rise. Vine was the hot new social media jam and annoying your parents with 6-second pranks was all the rage. Dallas even broadened his appeal just as the app officially shuttered in 2017 by securing lucrative modeling gigs with both Calvin Klein and Dolce &amp; Gabbana. He was also doing the movie-star-in-the-making rounds at Los Angeles and Manhattan media events.<br /><br />But that's where the new kid hit the skids. Cameron's exactly on-brand feature film debut was the 2014 prank flick, Expelled, which got a dismal audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with only three critics bothering to weigh in. Next came Chasing Cameron Dallas, his low-rated 2016 Netflix reality series that was canceled after just one season.<br /><br />Professional troubles became personal struggles as Dallas was arrested for assault in January 2019. At the time, he claimed self-defense. Eight months later, he revealed a two-and-a-half year battle with, quote, &quot;addiction, anxiety, depression,&quot; and &quot;family trauma&quot; that included a stint in rehab. Dallas has since opened up about his vices, rebranding himself as a crooner in a series of slick-looking music videos that have not exactly taken off, no thanks to his 21.5 million Instagram followers.
