All so different, yet so similar at the same time. <br /><br />Blackmagic's &quot;No need&quot; explores the often complicated layers of a romantic relationship; unspoken pains and misunderstandings, unexpressed feelings, complicated love.<br />An inescapable human emotion, love is not always romantic, easy or straightforward<br /><br />Epilogue:<br /><br />&quot;We were so in love, what happened?&quot;<br />&quot;I never knew it would be so difficult, but its been worth it&quot;<br />&quot;I can't believe its been 20 years! We're still so in love&quot;<br />&quot;Is it better to have loved and lost or not loved at all?&quot;<br />&quot;A diamond with a flaw is worth more than a pebble without imperfection&quot;<br />&quot;A love story is a love story no matter how it ends&quot;<br />&quot;Live and love regardless&quot;
