Hey my loves! I’ve decided to start a new series on my channel called “Single <br />&amp; Saved” where I will be challenging myself to 365 days of complete singleness. I will talk about the things I’ve learned in this journey, the importance of it, and just anything I come across in this new experience! Stay Tuned!<br /><br />THIS VIDEO will be talking about why I decided to challenge myself to 365 days of complete singleness! Along with why I think God has called me to a season of singleness!<br /><br />I may be the sign you’re looking for if you think God is calling you to a season of singleness or if you’re just fed up with relationships for the moment. Let’s take this journey together! <br /><br /><br />—————————————————————————<br />Disclaimer:<br />I DO NOT OWN ANY MUSIC USED IN THIS VIDEO.
