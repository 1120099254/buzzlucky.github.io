This series of videos is packed full of powerful techniques you can use in a range of situations such as making requests, following up on requests, saying ‘no’, giving feedback and raising difficult issues.<br />When people are assertive, they portray a strong, confident image and can put their views across while taking other people’s opinions into account. Non-assertive, passive aggressive or aggressive behaviour can cause misunderstandings, frustration and even a break down in relationships at work.<br />Discover how effective body language, voice, and the words you say make a big difference to the results you get.<br />Learn how to use valuable techniques, including empathic assertion, ‘broken record’ and discrepancy assertion – and, most importantly, the ability to say ‘no’ when appropriate.
