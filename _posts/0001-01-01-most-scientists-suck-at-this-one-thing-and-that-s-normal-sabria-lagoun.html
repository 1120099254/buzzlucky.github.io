Ultra-experts have to focus on their field of knowledge. They gather an incredible amount of information, with a precision and granularity that the rest of us won't have. However, these findings published in journals are often not read by any scientists other than the ultra experts of the same branch. It's a normal phenomenon that cries for more transdisciplinary science communicators who are able to bring knowledge to the general public and the industry.<br /><br />In this talk, Sabria Lagoun talks about her experience diverging from academia into a scientific communication.<br /><br /><br />Join our Event:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tedxtuwien.at">https://tedxtuwien.at</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/tedxtuwien">https://facebook.com/tedxtuwien</a><br /><br />Video Production:<br />Daysatreef<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://daysatreef.com">https://daysatreef.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/daysatreef">https://facebook.com/daysatreef</a><br /><br />Intro Music:<br />Hand mit Auge<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://handmitauge.com">https://handmitauge.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/handmitauge">https://facebook.com/handmitauge</a><br /><br />Logo Animation and Sound:<br />Alexander KÃ¶pplmayr<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pixelkompass.at">https://pixelkompass.at</a><br />Ines Vorreiter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/happinevor">https://www.instagram.com/happinevor</a><br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
