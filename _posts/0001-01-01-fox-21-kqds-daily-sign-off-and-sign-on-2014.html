This is a sign off clip I recorded. It plays at 12:30 AM each day. Most TV signoffs ended years back, but this one still occurs daily! It consists of a local ad, followed by a Fox 21 logo, a goodnight animation, our national anthem, and then a loop of the local weather. The weather loops with classical music in the background, until 6 AM, when the same National Anthem clip is played again, there is a wakeup animation, and then they play paid programming.<br /><br />Edit: Recently they edited their signoff clip to cut straight to the weather loop after the logo, and not display the anthem clip/goodnight animation. How disappointing, although I'm surprised they did it this long!<br /><br />0:00 Video intro<br />0:10 End of previous show<br />0:23 Local ad<br />0:33 FOX 21 Logo<br />0:43 Goodnight Animation<br />0:54 Anthem clip<br />2:29 Black screen<br />2:51 Weather loop overnight<br />This loop is cut in the middle, since it lasts several hours...<br />7:38 Anthem clip<br />9:13 Goodmorning Animation<br />9:23 Paid Programming begins<br /><br />Fox 21 is a Red River Broadcasting station.
