A city themed level from the incredibly talented F5night, his levels always having a theme, and we're used to seeing them being executed very well, and this is no different, his super detailed style and art is always an enormous pleasure to look at, this one being mostly dominated by the color blue, with some red and purple accents here and there, with a ton of neon all around the block design and backgrounds, the effects are great as well, having some lighting and text effects, with some explosions to top it off. The really short gun boss that you find at the end looks great, the effects on it's attacks are nice and it's movements are smooth as well.<br /><br />Music: Authority by Xtrullor<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/765333">https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/765333</a>
