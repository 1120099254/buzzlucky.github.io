He grew up with the passion for music and focused his attention on electronic music from 2009 when he first decided to start producing .<br />In the meantime, he started experimenting on different musical styles with his studio partner Jean Redondo under the « Daxyl » alias where he shaped his taste for raw and hard tones.<br />UVB concentrated on his techno project from 2013 when he started developing his own version of a live which was a set only composed of his own productions, and played it at clubs in Berlin (Urban Spree, Tresor).<br />In 2014, he released is first EP on the Rotterdam based label MORD, followed by the double pack « Second Life » that have both been supported by some of the biggest names of the Techno scene such as Surgeon, Marcel Dettmann, Tommy Four Seven..<br />The year 2015 marked an important progress on both DJ and production sides. He decided to be dedicated full-time on producing music and performing as a DJ and started touring Europe; Asia and South America, playing in the finest techno institutions. ( Berghain, Factory 010, Concrete..) He kept on producing and released one more EP on Fracture soon to be followed by his first LP « Life » on MORD records at the end of the year.<br />As for now, UVB is working on new music in preparation for the launch of his own label « Body Theory » and delivers his own vision of Techno through the numerous dj gigs he is playing around the world.
