TV On The Radio - DLZ  [Breaking Bad]<br />TV On The Radio - DLZ [Во все тяжкие]<br />Lyrics<br />Congratulations on the mess you made of things <br />On trying to reconstruct the air and all that brings <br />And oxidation is the compromise you own <br />But this is beginning to feel like the dog wants her bone <br />saved <br />La La Laaaa La La Lalala <br />La La Laaaa La La Lalala <br />La La Laaaa La La Lalala <br />La La Laaaa La La Lalala <br /><br />You force your fire then you falsify your deeds <br />Your methods dot the disconnect from all your creeds <br />And fortune strives to fill the vacuum that it feeds <br />But this is beginning to feel like the dog's lost her lead <br />she say<br />La La Laaaa La La Lalala <br />La La Laaaa La La Lalala <br />La La Laaaa La La Lalala <br />La La Laaaa La La Lalala <br /><br />This is beginning to feel like the long <br />winded blues of the never <br />This is beginning to feel like it's curling up slowly <br />and finding a throat to choke<br /><br />This is beginning to feel like the long <br />winded blues of the never <br />Barely controlled locomotive consuming the picture <br />and blowing the crows, the smoke<br /><br />This is beginning to feel like the long <br />winded blues of the never <br />Static explosion devoted to crushing the broken <br />and shoving their souls to ghost<br />Eternalised. Objectified. <br />You set your sights so high. <br />But this is beginning to feel like <br />the bolt busted loose from the lever<br /><br />Never mind <br />Death professor <br />Your structure's fine <br />My dust is better <br />Your victim flies so high <br />All to catch a bird's eye view of who's next<br /><br />Never you mind <br />Death professor. <br />Love is life, <br />My love is better. <br />You set your sights so high <br />Eyes could be the diamonds <br />Confused with who's next<br /><br />Never you mind <br />Death professor. <br />Your shocks are fine, <br />My struts are better. <br />Your fiction flies so high, <br />Y'all could use a doctor <br />Who's sick, who's next?<br /><br />Never you mind <br />Death professor. <br />Electrified, my love is better <br />It's crystallized, so am I. <br />All could be the diamond <br />Fused with who's next<br /><br />This is beginning to feel like the dawn of a loser forever<br /><br />This is beginning to feel like the dawn of a loser forever<br /><br />This is beginning to feel like the dawn of a loser forever
