I have replaced the banjo seals and bolts on the return line. Has anyone seen an injector leak right between solenoid and the body? The sealing surface of the injector where the banjo meets was not nicked or worn in  any way. The injector is a reman and has about 15k miles on it. Leak breaks loose in the 18th second.
