When it's born, it's just a foot high 1 ft (30 cm). But the closer it gets to the shore, the larger it grows. Soon, it enters shallow waters and starts to slow down. Down there, humans - tiny like ants - scream and scatter in different directions. The first tsunami wave crashes into the shore. Its top moves faster than the bottom - that's what makes the wave so high and steep.<br /><br />The lowest point of the wave gets to dry land first. In the process, it creates a vacuum effect that pulls the water away from the coast, baring the harbor and seafloor. Those who recognize this first sign of an approaching tsunami still have the chance to save their lives. Five minutes later - and an enormous wall of water hits the shore and wipes out everything in its way. But it's not just a single wave - there are many. The scariest thing about tsunamis is that they can travel across entire oceans with almost no energy loss!<br /><br />#brightside<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />How a tsunami wave works 0:01<br />A tsunami's height 1:16<br />What can cause a tsunami? 2:38<br />Where 80% of tsunamis get born 4:40<br />Will the Pacific Ocean disappear? 8:45<br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>
