I love all the euphora in the stock market. Its when I feel most safe standing on the sidelines as everyone dives out in front of a bulldozer to pick up pennies. My sentiment stock market indicator today flipped a warning signal. The next to happen is the sell signal. Greed and euphoria don't last forever at these levels, so it's okay to be bearish temporary in extreme bullish levels. <br /><br />Careful out there, protect your capital and do NOT become complacent.<br /><br />WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://FiguringOut.Money">https://FiguringOut.Money</a><br /><br />COME SAY HI:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/figuringoutmoney">https://www.instagram.com/figuringoutmoney</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mikepsilva">https://twitter.com/mikepsilva</a><br /><br />STOCK TRADING PLATFORM I USE<br />○ Webull (GET 2 FREE STOCKS): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3i5U591">https://bit.ly/3i5U591</a><br /><br />MY FAVORITES - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amz.run/3JLv">https://amz.run/3JLv</a><br />○ Book Recommendations<br />○ My Studio Setup<br />○ Morning Coffee<br /><br />COME SAY HI:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/figuringoutmoney">https://www.instagram.com/figuringoutmoney</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mikepsilva">https://twitter.com/mikepsilva</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I am not a professional investment advisor, nor do I claim to be.
