I don't want to hurt you<br /><br />For no reason have I but fear<br /><br />And I ain't guilty of the crimes you accuse me of<br /><br />But I'm guilty of fear<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm sorry to remind<br /><br />You but I'm scared of what we're creating<br /><br />This life ain't fair<br /><br />You don't get something for nothing, turn now<br /><br />Mmmm gotta try a little harder<br /><br /><br /><br />It could be sweet<br /><br />Like a long forgotten dream<br /><br />And we don't need them to cast the fate we have<br /><br />Love don't always shine thru<br /><br /><br /><br />Cos I don't wanna lose<br /><br />What we had last time your leaving this life ain't fair<br /><br />You don't get something for nothing, turn now<br /><br />Mmmm gotta try a little harder<br /><br /><br /><br />It could be sweet.....<br /><br /><br /><br />But the thoughts we try to deny<br /><br />Take a toll upon our lives<br /><br />We struggle on in depths of pride<br /><br />Tangled up in single minds<br /><br /><br /><br />Cos I don't wanna lose<br /><br />What we had last time your leaving this life ain't fair<br /><br />You don't get something for nothing, turn back<br /><br />Mmmm gotta try a little harder<br /><br /><br /><br />Cos I don't wanna lose<br /><br />What we had last time your leaving this life ain't fair<br /><br />You don't get something for nothing, turn back<br /><br />Mmmm gotta try a little harder<br /><br /><br /><br />It could be sweet
