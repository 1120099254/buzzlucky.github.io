Follow along with me on my FIRST day of American public school...<br /><br />I don't have a fancy morning routine or anything like that but I do enjoy drinking coffee and riding my bike to school. This year will be my junior year (11th grade) of high school at Chapel Hill High school. It's going to be a busy busy year but before everything gets even crazier I was able to film a video of our first day. I hope you enjoy seeing this perspective into an American high school. <br /><br />Let me know what you find interesting or different! Let's start a conversation/dialogue in the comments! <br /><br />So, essentially my channel is &quot;blowing up&quot; as I write this post. It's all very exciting and I'm so glad to have a ton of new people here! The timing is perfect because my first day of French public school video is where everyone is coming from so what better video to post than my first day of American public school! I hope you all enjoy it and a big welcome to those who are new around here!<br /><br />➪<br />Thank you!<br />ヅ<br />Current Sub count when the video was posted: 5,496
