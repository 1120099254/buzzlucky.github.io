So that's something I felt I had to draw. As usual, I don't own the music and I don't own the video at the end, either. This is all from Joy Division the band, and, though I don't usually say such things when I use music and video: you should all look in to it. Because it's fantastic. The song I used is called &quot;Transmission.&quot; This was a 1979 demo.
