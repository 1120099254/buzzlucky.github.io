In this 18 min workshop style practice, we work to bring some awareness to the sweet hands and wrists.<br /><br />With so many joints in the hands, this is a body part that is susceptible to injury and arthritis if not properly taken care of and where many yogi’s often experience wrist fatigue or pain.<br /><br />Optimal alignment and weight distribution in the hands and wrists are very important and in this video, Adriene guides the proper hand placement in poses like downward facing dog.<br /><br />Stretch out the fingers, warm up the wrists, and set up for success with a strong foundation.<br /><br />For more videos focused on the hands and wrists, check out our Yoga For the Hands and Wrists Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-UzxgKRk9y3aKetQ7mPnzAKA4">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLui6Eyny-UzxgKRk9y3aKetQ7mPnzAKA4</a><br /><br />#yogawithadriene   #freeyoga   #fwfg<br />  <br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />❤️SUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! ❤️<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />🧘🏽‍♂️🧘‍♀️Become a FWFG YOGA member! 🧘🏻‍♂️🧘🏿‍♀️<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fwfg.com">https://fwfg.com</a><br />Join Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.
