#JamesBond #007 #LashanaLynch<br /><br />18 months ago, Midnight’s Edge first reported on the rumors that Lashana Lynch would be replacing Daniel Craig’s James Bond as the new 007. Many scoffed at it at the time, but as we shall see in this video, the rumors are now confirmed, and those not overwhelmingly supportive of it are already being gaslit, in accordiance with the Ghostbusters 2016 playbook.<br /><br />Earlier videos on the topic:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/IcinPMX7zAA">https://youtu.be/IcinPMX7zAA</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/quE_xo37Gzk">https://youtu.be/quE_xo37Gzk</a><br /><br />Please share, like, subscribe, and follow us on… <br />Facebook: Facebook.com/Groups/MidnightsEdge <br />Twitter: @Midnights_Edge<br /> <br />And support us here for cool extra features: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.subscribestar.com/midnightsedge">https://www.subscribestar.com/midnightsedge</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/midnightsedge">https://www.patreon.com/midnightsedge</a><br /><br />We also welcome one-time Paypal donations at:<br />contact@midnightsedge.me<br /><br />Send us stuff!<br />MIDNIGHT'S EDGE<br />(C/O Tom Connors)<br />PO Box 325<br />Hillsboro, WI 54634<br /><br />Music:<br />Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br />Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...</a><br /><br />FAIR USE NOTICE.
