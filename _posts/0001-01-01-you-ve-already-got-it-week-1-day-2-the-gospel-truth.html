But some of these same believers find themselves unable to reconcile the Word with what they experience. They live in frustration or disillusionment, wondering why God’s promises don’t seem to be working for them. But God is no respecter of persons (Rom. 2:11). What He has done for one, He’s done for all.<br /><br />With Andrew’s You've Already Got It! teaching, you’ll learn how to go from frustration to fulfillment in your relationship with God and His promises. The truth is, you’re not waiting on God to bless you. He has already done it!<br /><br />Follow Andrew Wommack Ministries on your favorite social platform: <br />- Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AWMinistries">https://www.facebook.com/AWMinistries</a> <br />- Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/andrewwommack">https://www.instagram.com/andrewwommack</a><br />- Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/andrewwommack">https://twitter.com/andrewwommack</a> <br />- Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/andrewwommack/">https://www.pinterest.com/andrewwommack/</a> <br />- YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewWo...">https://www.youtube.com/user/AndrewWo...</a> <br />- Periscope: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pscp.tv/andrewwommack">https://www.pscp.tv/andrewwommack</a><br /><br />Learn about Charis Bible College at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://CharisBibleCollege.org">https://CharisBibleCollege.org</a> <br />Learn about upcoming events at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.awmi.net/events/">https://www.awmi.net/events/</a><br /><br /><br />00:31 Hello and welcome to our Tuesday's broadcast of The Gospel Truth.<br />03:37 But rather he was saying, “God, help him to recognize and acknowledge what you've already done.”<br />10:04 We aren't trying to get god to do something. We're trying to renew our minds and receive what has already been provided for us.<br />13:06 I know I'm already rubbing people the wrong way. I'm going against religious tradition, but those are stupid prayers.<br />17:08 So please don't think that I'm sitting here criticizing other people. <br />20:58 It's us yielding to God and allowing him to flow through us.
