One of the rarest personality types in this system is the INFJ, which is characterized by Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, and Judgement. This type of personality makes up less than 2% of the world’s population and people with this kind of personality are known for their warm empathy, keen insights, and deep insights into human potential. Do you think you might be an INFJ? Watch this video to find out. <br /><br />Previously, we also made a video on the differences between INFP and INFJ.
