Restoration an abandoned DUCATI  racing motorbike ( Children's electric car) | Rebuild and restore <br /><br />Hello everyone, today I was walking when I suddenly saw an abandoned children's electric motorbike at a corner of the pond, it seems its owner did not need it, I took it to clean and repairing electric motors and electrical systems, surprisingly it's still working. I am very happy for this. don't forget to leave your comments, like, share and subscribe to support me, thank you very much, wish you a nice day
