For plans, click &quot;Show More&quot; below. --- Make your generator or air compressor 5x quieter using a box  that can be disassembled and stored.  I also show the exhaust system that prevents carbon monoxide poisoning.   I show a video of my 3500 watt  generator running alone, and while it continues to run I assemble a quiet box that I built, around it. The video shows the audio waveform of the generator's sound decreasing as the box is assembled, and my video editor's &quot;db full scale&quot; meter is also shown in real-time. Finally I show the generator running alone and compare it to the generator running in the quiet box in 3 second bursts to allow you to hear the before and after difference.<br /><br />I also show how the panels of the disassembled quiet box can be arranged for storage in the bottom of a small clothes closet -or- in a small footprint configuration for storage in an even smaller footprint space.<br /><br />PLANS: (Still available as of 12/1/20)<br />Because of many requests to buy plans for my quiet box, I put a package together that consists of plans and step-by-step instructions for building my quiet box and both sound baffles. I've updated the plans with optional rainshields that can replace the sound baffles for outdoor use.  Also included are a video, the Sketchup files for my quiet box and baffles, and bonus plans for 5 larger size quiet boxes.  If interested with no obligation to purchase, send a request for pricing and what the package contains to usefulgizmos@gmail.com.<br /><br />Do a search on youtube for &quot;usefulgizmos&quot; to get links to all of my  other youtube videos.
