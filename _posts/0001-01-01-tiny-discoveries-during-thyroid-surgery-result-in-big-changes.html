Thyroid cancer spreads to lymph nodes making thyroid cancer surgery more difficult and thyroid cancer harder to cure. Watch Dr Gary Clayman discover lymph nodes with thyroid cancer inside of them during a thyroid operation. In a previous video we show that some thyroid cancers can be cured with removal of only half of the thyroid (a thyroid lobectomy). In this video Dr Clayman finds cancer spread into lymph nodes which means this patient needs their entire thyroid removed. Read more about lymph nodes with cancer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thyroidcancer.com/thyroid-cancer-surgery/cancer-lymph-nodes.">http://www.thyroidcancer.com/thyroid-cancer-surgery/cancer-lymph-nodes.</a> When the cancer spreads into the lymph nodes this is called metastatic thyroid cancer to lymph nodes. The thyroid surgery must be done by a thyroid cancer expert surgeon who knows how to find these small lymph nodes to check them for cancer spread so the patient gets the best operation to cure the cancer.
