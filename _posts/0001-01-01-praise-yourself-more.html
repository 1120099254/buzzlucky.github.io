A few days ago some one said to me ''self-praise stinks'' because i said i am a good dancer.<br /><br />that made me think about that Phrase ''self-praise stinks''<br />i came to the conclusion that we should behave diffrently about this!<br /><br />there are enough People and struggles we have to face everyday! and i am here to tell you that you should praise your self MORE!<br />because all of us have qualities!<br />i want us all to be confident! don't listen to people that want to put you down!<br />be PROUD of what you got! we don't get praised enough for the good things we do! so let's just do it our selfes.<br /><br />Subscribe for new Videos every week!<br /><br />follow on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thisisrusko/">https://www.instagram.com/thisisrusko/</a><br />like on Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RuskoSatic/">https://www.facebook.com/RuskoSatic/</a>
