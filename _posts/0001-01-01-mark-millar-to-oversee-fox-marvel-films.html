Millar has written several celebrated Marvel titles like Civil War, The Ultimates and Wolverine: Old Man Logan...and the book-to-film properties Kick-Ass and Wanted...Now 20th Century Fox has recruited the multihyphenate to advise on what he knows best...the studio's Marvel superheroes. <br /><br />First up, Millar will sprinkle his creative vision over Fox's fantastic four and x-men tentpoles. Fantastic Four will return to theatres with a franchise reboot and an entirely new cast of heroes....but first Hugh Jackman returns as Logan in The wolverine, accompanied by 3:10 to Yuma director James Mangold at the helm. There's more mutants to follow with X-Men: Days of Future past, helmed by Kick Ass director Matthew Vaughn. <br /><br />A self-professed life long comics nerd, Millar wants to make movies the fans will love...and already he's received an avalanche of congratulations on his social media accounts...but the most notable well wishes came from the great Stan Lee...which Millar says is like getting a message from the pope himself. So are you excited to see Millar in this new, influential position over at Fox? And do you think he's got the chops to be as successful as Joss Whedon when it comes to comic-to-film adaptations? Let us know in the comments below and be sure to keep clicking Clevver Movies all day long for the latest movie news. I'm Simone Boyce in Hollywood and thanks for watching!
