Welcome to my channel! I'm a video blogger who makes videos every Monday and Friday. This channel is really about me. I talk about things like relationships and dating, sexuality, bisexuality, mental health (depression, addiction, anxiety, etc.), and a lot of feelings. I like to take my experiences and turn them into something creative, whether that's through vlogging or other projects. Subscribe for more!
