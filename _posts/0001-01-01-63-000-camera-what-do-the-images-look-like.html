The Phase One XF is the most high-end camera system you can buy. I recently had a chance to use this setup with the IQ3 monochrome back. I was told this back is the first one in the US so I was pretty excited.<br /><br />This camera setup is a game changer. The Phase One IQ3 Monochrome back is one of the most exciting things to happen in camera design in the age of digital photography. The sensor weighs in at a cool 101 Megapixels and its designed to capture light past the visual spectrum. When you understand how to shape this using filters you have one of the most advanced, digital monochrome cameras ever made. The results are stunning.<br /><br />Special Thanks to Digital Transitions for loaning me the camera and to Rod Clark who makes the best filter system on the market for setting it all up!
