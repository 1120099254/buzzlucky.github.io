Guys keep asking me how to make better choices with women, and how to test them for a potential relationship, here are 3 shit tests you can use on women to see if they deserve your attention longer term.<br /><br />1. Get her to buy you a coffee<br />2. Saying no to something you aren't interested in<br />3. Have the prenup talk.<br /><br />It all boils down to how they respond, watch the video, and leave a comment below to let me know what you think.<br /><br /><br />Get 1 on 1 Coaching With Me:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://clarity.fm/richardcooper">https://clarity.fm/richardcooper</a><br />Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/EntreprenursInCars/">https://www.facebook.com/EntreprenursInCars/</a><br />Twitter! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Rich_Cooper">https://twitter.com/Rich_Cooper</a><br />Instagram! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurs_in_cars/">https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurs_in_cars/</a><br /><br />Suggested reading for all men:<br />The rational male:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2i9dfjW">http://amzn.to/2i9dfjW</a><br />Bachelor Pad Economics:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2kNP7UG">http://amzn.to/2kNP7UG</a><br />The Way of Men:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2kLFB1p">http://amzn.to/2kLFB1p</a><br /><br />Â© Richard Cooper - For all enquiries contact EntrepreneursinCars@Gmail.com - This video is not to be reproduced without prior authorisation.
