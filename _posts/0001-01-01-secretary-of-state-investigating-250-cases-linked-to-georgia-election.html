Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger says more than 250 cases linked to the 2020 election are under investigation including claims of absentee ballots outnumbering envelopes, dead “double voters” and non-resident voters.<br /><br />Speaking in Atlanta, Mr Raffensperger also announced an investigation into possible breaches of electoral law.<br /><br />“As we move to the December 1st election, which is tomorrow, and the January 5th federal run-offs, we have to remain vigilant,” he said.<br /><br />“That is why I’m announcing an investigation into third-party groups working to register people in other states to vote here in Georgia.<br /><br />“Casting an illegal vote in Georgia is a felony, casting more than one vote in Georgia is a felony, in one election obviously, this office will continue to take steps to protect the voting rights of the legally registered Georgians of this state: Republican, Democrat, independent and whatever other party you may be a member of.”<br /><br />Mr Raffensperger said the state’s recount was due Wednesday, local time, and stressed the state would be as “transparent as possible” while also pushing back against claims of voter fraud.<br /><br />“Once this recount is complete, everyone in Georgia will be able to have even more confidence in the results of our elections, despite the massive amounts of misinformation that is being spread by dishonest actors,” he said. <br /><br />“There are those who are exploiting the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation, and, frankly, they are misleading the president as well apparently.”
