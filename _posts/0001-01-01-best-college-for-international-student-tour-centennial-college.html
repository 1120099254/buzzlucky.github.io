It is the oldest publicly funded college in Ontario.[1] Its campuses are primarily situated on the east side of the city, particularly in Scarborough,[1] although its new aerospace centre is located at Downsview Park in North York.[2] The enabling legislation is the Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities Act.[3] Centennial College is recognized as one of the most culturally diverse post-secondary institutions in Ontario.[1] Almost 100 ethnocultural groups are represented and 80 languages are spoken on campus.[1] In 2016, Centennial was ranked as one of Canada's Top 10 Research Colleges for the first time in its history.[4] Its main research facilities are its Wearable, Interactive and Mobile Technologies Access Centre in Healthcare (WIMTACH), established in 2015 through a $1.75 million federal grant.[5] and its new aerospace innovation hub, currently under construction at the former de Havilland plant in west-end Toronto.[6] (Source - Wikipedia)<br /><br />Source for more info: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centennial_College">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centennial_College</a><br />College Website:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.centennialcollege.ca/">https://www.centennialcollege.ca/</a><br /><br />LINKS:<br />PRESTO CARD WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.prestocard.ca/en/">https://www.prestocard.ca/en/</a><br />TTC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ttc.ca/">http://www.ttc.ca/</a><br /><br />LINKS FOR SOCIAL MEDIA:<br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/_iamlad_/">https://www.instagram.com/_iamlad_/</a><br />SNAPCHAT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.snapchat.com/add/lad_harsh18">https://www.snapchat.com/add/lad_harsh18</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/harsh.lad.3990">https://www.facebook.com/harsh.lad.3990</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HarshLad14">https://twitter.com/HarshLad14</a><br /><br />LINKS FOR FINDING HOME:<br />KIJIJI: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kijiji.ca/b-city-of-toron...">https://www.kijiji.ca/b-city-of-toron...</a> EDIT THE LOCATION)<br /><br />SEARCH4STUDENTHOUSING: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.search4studenthousing.com/">https://www.search4studenthousing.com/</a><br /><br />NESTPICK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nestpick.com/student-acco...">https://www.nestpick.com/student-acco...</a><br /><br />LINK FOR DOWNLOADING APPS:<br />TRANSIT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...">https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...</a><br /><br />UBER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...">https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...</a> [use promo code: &quot;harshl231ue&quot; for $5 OFF]<br /><br />LYFT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...">https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...</a>  [use promo code:&quot;HARSH44166&quot; for $50 CREDIT]<br /><br />FOLLOW ME AND SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL.<br />THANKS FOR WATCHING MY VIDEO AND GOING THROUGH THIS DESCRIPTION.
