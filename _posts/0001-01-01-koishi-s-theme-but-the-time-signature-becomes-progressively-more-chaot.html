I felt like doing something fun as a break, i transcribed Harmann's Youkai Girl a while ago, so i thought &quot;what if it had even crazier time signatures?&quot;, so i did that, and i also added a little piano solo at the end just for fun.<br />Also i'm going on a holiday for a while, i'll be back in May!
