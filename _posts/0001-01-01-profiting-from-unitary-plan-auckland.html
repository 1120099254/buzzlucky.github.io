The Auckland Unitary Plan is the rule book that provides for the ongoing development of Auckland.  That may be in the CBD where 50+m high buildings are proposed to small shopping areas, residential development or the management of our rural, coastal and wetland areas.<br />The Auckland region is vast, spreading from beyond Wellsford in the north to and including Pukekohe in the south.  It is home to 1.5m people with another million expected in the next 30 years.
