Tupi Guarani Tales is a wonderful and intriguing new composition that Sérgio Assad wrote for my South American album 'Open Sky.' This piece is inspired by the Tupi-Guarani peoples from Brazil and is a musically fascinating work, where the bottom string is tuned down a semitone to E flat, adding some vivid, picturesque harmonies.<br /><br />I recorded this video in September before my concert at the Saint Charles Church in Sedan, France. If you are interested in learning this piece, it will soon be available on a great new learning platform called Guitar By Masters. There you can already find some other pieces by Sérgio that I have recorded!<br /><br />www.guitarbymasters.com<br />CD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cd.stephjon.es">https://cd.stephjon.es</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/stephjonesguitar">https://www.patreon.com/stephjonesguitar</a><br /><br />Production: Jakob Schmidt<br />Guitar: Paul Sheridan (2012)<br />Support: Guitarlift<br />Strings: Hannabach<br />Thumbnail photo: Vic Pooters
