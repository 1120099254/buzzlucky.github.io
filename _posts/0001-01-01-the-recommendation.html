Aaron is smart, charming and over-privileged.  Iskinder, his new college roommate, comes from a middle-class immigrant family and is under-connected.  Soon the best of friends, Aaron takes Iskinder under his wing, sharing his world of favors and fortune.  But the safe haven of college only lasts so long.  After a chance encounter with an accused felon sets off a chain of events that puts Aaron's life at risk, the two men are forced to rethink the meaning of friendship.  <br /><br /><br /><br />The cast of The Recommendation features Jimonn Cole (Dwight Barnes), Brandon Gill (Iskinder Iudoku) and Evan Todd (Aaron Feldman).
