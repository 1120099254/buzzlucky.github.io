If you want the template I use in the video, here it is:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mailchi.mp/90b9c0f443b5/none">https://mailchi.mp/90b9c0f443b5/none</a><br /><br />I was recently asked a question close to this: &quot;How can I create a constraint such that respondents can’t select “None of the Above” and another option.  I want to create a constraint that prevents selecting “None of the Above” and any other option from a multiple_select question.”<br /><br />This applies when you're building your form in XLSForm or in KoboToolbox, for example.<br /><br />This is such a good question.  And it is very common in humanitarian and development questionnaires, where we give a list of options and say “select ALL that apply”.  And then at the bottom of the list, we might have options like:<br />- Not applicable<br />- I don’t know<br />- None of the above<br /><br />But it wouldn’t make sense if the questionnaire allowed you to select “None of the above” with another option also.  <br /><br />So…there is a great constraint that you can use in your Kobo Toolbox forms to prevent this from happening.<br /><br />Are you an aid or development worker?  If yes, I'd love it if you subscribe to this channel!
