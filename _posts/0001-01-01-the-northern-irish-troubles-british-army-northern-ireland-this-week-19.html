*This is a shortened version of the original programme*<br />The British Army prepares to face its fourth Christmas in Northern Ireland. Since the troops were sent in 1969 the army has suffered more casualties than in any other operation since the second world war. Peter Taylor talks to soldiers on the ground about their job and what they have to do â€“ it is the first time since direct rule that any television team has been given unrestricted access to the Army. <br /><br />First shown: 21/12/1972<br />If you would like to license a clip from this video please e mail:<br />archive@fremantle.com<br />Quote: VT7108
