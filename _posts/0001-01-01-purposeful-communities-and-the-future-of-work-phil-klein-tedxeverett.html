This talk provides a strategy for how people can deliver high value results for companies and organizations by forming and engaging in purposeful communities. A long-time designer of community strategy and experiences, Phil Klein lays out a clear pathway for us to create communities that provide belonging and achieve envisioned aims that are both successful for organizations and satisfying for participants. In the wide field of understanding social dynamics in regards to work, especially in the social era where collaboration is essential within and across organizations of every type, this talk presents a compelling case for approaches that let people cultivate a meaningful sense of belonging while achieving excellence. <br /><br />Phil is obsessed with making experiences as good as they can possibly be, in the workplace and in communities where values and shared purpose are held together and lead to action. He works collaboratively with organizations to develop strategies, practices, programs, and events that catalyze and activate high quality, purposeful community engagement. He has worked with Snohomish County Arts Commission, Sno-Isle Libraries, UW, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and he was the Community Experience Producer for TED2014. He has also been an active member of the TEDx organizer community, co-founding TEDxRainier (now TEDxSeattle) in 2010. He is Founder of Community Knowledge Works and loves to have great conversations while learning together.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
