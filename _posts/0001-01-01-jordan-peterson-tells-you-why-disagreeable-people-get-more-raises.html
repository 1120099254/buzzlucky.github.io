It can be construed as cooperation vs competition, or compliance vs non-compliance, or tender-mindedness vs tough-mindedness. It is also an important determinant of political belief, being the trait most associated with the body of ideas that has come to be known as politically correct.<br /><br />Agreeable people tend to view the political world as innocent infant vs reptilian predator. Perhaps this is good for you (although probably not) if you are placed in the innocent infant category, but it is not so good if you are deemed reptilian predator :)<br /><br />Do you want to support his channel?<br /><br />Please go to his website located in the link below:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate/">https://jordanbpeterson.com/donate/</a><br /><br />If you would like to support my channel<br />Please go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.subscribestar.com/thearchangel911">https://www.subscribestar.com/thearchangel911</a><br /><br />Thank you for all your support.
