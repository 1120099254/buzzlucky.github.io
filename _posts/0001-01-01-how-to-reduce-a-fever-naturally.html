Here are some simple ways to bring your temperature down without medicine.<br /><br />Step 1: Get lots of rest<br />Your body is running a high temperature because of an infection, so get plenty of rest. This lets your body concentrate fully on fighting the infection.<br /><br />Step 2: Drink lots of fluids<br />Drinking a lot of water – 10 8-ounce glasses a day at least when you're sick – keeps your body hydrated, and will also lower your internal temperature.<br /><br />Step 3: Take a lukewarm bath<br />Take a nice lukewarm bath. Not too hot, which could escalate the fever, and not too cold, which could shock your system. This will lower your skin temperature gradually.<br /><br />Tip<br />Avoid cooling off the body too quickly, or you won't rid yourself of the infection your body is fighting.<br /><br />Step 4: Cool washcloths<br />Place cool – not cold – washcloths on the wrists, under the arm, on the forehead, and over the groin. Using cool, damp rags over these four key areas will slowly cool the body.<br /><br />Step 5: Put damp socks on your feet<br />While you're putting cool rags over various body parts, put a pair of cool, damp socks on your feet, with a dry pair over the top. This lets your ankles cool while still allowing you to walk around.<br /><br />Step 6: Keep the home a moderate temperature<br />Even though a person running a fever may feel cold, do not overheat the home. Instead, keep the house at a moderate temperature of 70 to 74 degrees.<br /><br />Step 7: Don't wear heavy clothing<br />A person running a fever should not wear heavy clothes or wrap themselves in heavy blankets. Doing so makes it difficult for the body to shed extra heat; instead, wear light clothing.<br /><br />Step 8: Monitor the fever<br />If these remedies don't work and a baby less than 3 months old is running a temperature of more than 101 degrees, or a child or adult's temperature is over 103 degrees, see a doctor.<br /><br />Did You Know?<br />Fever is also known as Pyrexia, which comes from the Greek word meaning fire.
