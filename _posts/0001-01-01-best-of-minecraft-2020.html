Please note: On Gamers React, you will discover highly edited gaming clips from streamers. Clips used in the video are submitted by fans through our email and discord server. I spend over 12 hours per video editing to transform these clips into something that has never been seen before! There is also commentary from me that is included within the video for either added entertainment or to highlight something the audience may have missed out on without said commentary. My edits include creative subtitles, that we edit (it may go bigger or smaller based on the personâ€™s speech or have some other kind of edit). Creative sound effects like cartoon effects when someone either falls from a high place, hits the ground, falls in lava, dies in the game, and much more. We include many memes in the video to make the video more entertaining for the viewer to watch as well as include many green screen effects to make the videos more comical and creative. We also spend time zooming in on peoples faces as well as zooming into certain parts of the video to highlight something the viewer may be missing out on if there were no zoom ins. We also manipulate audio or video in our clips to ensure there is no dead air for our viewers to watch. Over 50 clips are used in every video and we come up with a creative way to alter EVERY SINGLE clip to make it our own and UNIQUE to OUR channel. The majority of the unedited (or original) version of the clips I use can NOT be found anywhere else on YouTube. If you have any concerns or want a clip of yours removed, please send an email at GamersReactingYT@gmail.com<br /><br />SUBMIT CLIPS IN THIS DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/9rH9a5Z">https://discord.gg/9rH9a5Z</a><br /><br />instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gamersreactyt/">https://www.instagram.com/gamersreactyt/</a><br />tik tok @gamersreactyt<br /><br />I enjoyed uploading videos so much this year so I decided to make a video of just all the highlights from this year. There is over 250 clips featured in this video and many of the clips have extra editing added on top of them. This video specifically took over 12 hours to create.<br /><br />All creators in this video have been featured in previous videos. Although, there is just simply too many creators used in this video to link every single one of them since YouTube only lets you have the description of your videos be 5000 characters long. If you want to find one of these creators, search them up either on twitch.tv or YouTube. Nametags for every creator is listed on the screen of their clip so make sure to check them out!<br /><br />More Related Videos to Enjoy:<br /><br />FUNNIEST Minecraft Fail Moments EVER #18<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70C95G_PgSE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70C95G_PgSE</a><br />YouTube portrayed by Minecraft<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaRj2cXmwHE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaRj2cXmwHE</a><br />MrBeast Gaming 100 Players, But Lava Rises Every Minute!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU99gX7NGZ8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU99gX7NGZ8</a><br />this minecraft story will make you cry<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFQ1aVPDA7M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFQ1aVPDA7M</a><br />Minecraft Speedrunner VS 4 Hunters FINALE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDkuUZ3F1GU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDkuUZ3F1GU</a>
