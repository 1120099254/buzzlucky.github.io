Hello, Friends! <br /><br />**If you can, please support your local bookstores during this time! My two favorites (Powell's and Annie Blooms) are in danger of having to shut down permanently because of the extreme loss of business.**<br /><br />Annie Blooms Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.annieblooms.com">https://www.annieblooms.com</a><br />Powell's Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.powells.com">https://www.powells.com</a><br /><br />Don't you just immediately feel at home in a bookstore? No matter where you are in the world, in a bookstore you can surround yourself with your most favorite and familiar characters, melting boundaries of time and space ✨ Landon and I spent our rainy Saturday night in THE LARGEST Independent Bookstore in the United States-- Powell's City of Books. This is my happy place in Portland; I could easily spend multiple consecutive days exploring the never-ending maze of books. <br /><br />I'm currently shopping for and planning my 2020 Reading list-- please feel free to share your favorite books with me! <br /><br />I'm so very happy you're here. Thank you for watching :) <br /><br />Hugs, <br />Morgan <br /><br />Powell's Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.powells.com">https://www.powells.com</a><br /><br />✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨<br /><br />My Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/morganlong">https://www.patreon.com/morganlong</a><br /><br />I get all of the music I use in my videos from: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/yhbsw3/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/yhbsw3/</a><br />And<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artlist.io">https://artlist.io</a> and <br /><br />My Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thenamesmorganlong/">https://www.instagram.com/thenamesmorganlong/</a><br /><br />My Spotify (I love making playlists): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/morganelizlong?si=xhX7R_btTJKa-57YIYAVCw">https://open.spotify.com/user/morganelizlong?si=xhX7R_btTJKa-57YIYAVCw</a>
