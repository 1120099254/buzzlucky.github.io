one of the vary rewarding aspects of my work has been the interaction with a superb group of colleagues and friends in the atmospheric education community. We colleagues once in a week always try to go on long drive. today we had a plane to go and to explore many beautiful places but due to some reason we just get a chance to have lunch in shangrila restaurant.
