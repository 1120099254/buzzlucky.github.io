Life goes on...<br />I'll pick myself back up, and carry on, <br />Forever looking forward, <br />NEVER LOOKING BACK,<br />I'll pick myself back up, and carry on, <br />Forever looking forward, never looking back.<br />I still have no regrets.<br />Everything happens for a reason,<br />Lessons learned and bridges burnt,<br />I found a reason to carry on,<br />To carry on.<br />I wish you had just told me the truth,<br />I know it's hard, but honestly,<br />How did you not think, this would hurt me.<br />This isn't how things should be.<br />I'll swallow my pride, and walk away,<br />There's nothing I can do, there's nothing you can say,<br />Who knows if our story will have a happy ending?<br />Right now do we care?<br />This isn't how things should be.
