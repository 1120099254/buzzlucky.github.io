Catch Your Fall (Strings Mix)<br /> <br />DAYS GONE BY<br />Written by Gavin Mikhail<br />Â© 2005 Tower Window Publishing (BMI)<br /><br />I won't break down this way<br />I will hold on for one more day<br />If you'll help me make myself feel<br />Something so much more than this, something that's real<br />I'll live, I'll love, I'll carry on<br />Pretending I don't notice that you're gone...<br /><br />But god I miss you<br />So much it hurts sometimes<br />And I can't bring us back to<br />All the days gone by<br />Why didn't I notice<br />That you were not quite fine?<br />Now I can't bring us back to<br />All the days gone by...<br /><br />Tell me why, make me see<br />How my giving up, giving in isn't what's best for me<br />You know I've tried<br />But I am terrified by all I should believe<br />I need to know to carry on<br />Pretending I don't notice that you're gone...<br /><br />But god I miss you<br />So much it hurts sometimes<br />And I can't bring us back to<br />All the days gone by<br />Why didn't I notice<br />That you were not quite fine?<br />Now I can't bring us back to<br />All the days gone by...<br /><br />And I may not always<br />Be there when you call my name<br />And I cannot promise<br />That the things you love in this life won't change<br />But I will be with you<br />In all that you say and do<br />'Cause you are part of me<br />And I, I will always love you<br />I will always love you<br />I will always love you...<br /><br />But god I miss you<br />So much it hurts sometimes<br />And I can't bring us back to<br />All the days gone by<br />Why didn't I notice<br />That you were not quite fine?<br />Now I can't bring us back to<br />All the days gone by<br />I took for granted<br />That you were in my life<br />Now I can't bring us back to<br />All the days gone by<br />I always loved you<br />I miss you all the time<br />I promise I'll remember<br />All the days gone by...
