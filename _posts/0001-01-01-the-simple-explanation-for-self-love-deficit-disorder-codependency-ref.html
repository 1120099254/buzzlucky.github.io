In this video, Rosenberg reduces his practical and theoretical explanations for his &quot;Codependency Cure™” work, which is the follow up to his Human Magnet Syndrome books. <br /><br />This is a mold-breaking information that represents the most modern thinking about codependency.  &quot;Codependency,” is re-defined and re-conceptualized into “Self-Love Deficit Disorder (SLDD)™,&quot; which is a trauma, core shame, pathological loneliness, and addiction disorder. <br /><br />“Self-Love Deficit Disorder (SLDD™)” is the crucial reformulation of the term “codependency.” It strips the antiquated and often misused word of its shaming connotations while providing a realistic description of the problem. As most people with SLDD will confirm, they would never be in harmful relationships with pathological narcissists if they had a stable sense of self-love.<br /><br />The full-length video seminar (5.5 hours) is available here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.selfloverecovery.com/collections/video-seminars-downloads/products/the-codependency-cure.">https://www.selfloverecovery.com/collections/video-seminars-downloads/products/the-codependency-cure.</a> Note, this material is not yet available in book form.<br /><br />More information about Ross Rosenberg services, educational and self-help resources can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.selfloverecovery.com/">https://www.selfloverecovery.com/</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://humanmagnetsyndrome.com/hmsblog/">http://humanmagnetsyndrome.com/hmsblog/</a> <br /><br />Ross Rosenberg M.Ed., LCPC, CADC, CSAT, is the owner of  Self-Love Recovery Institute.
