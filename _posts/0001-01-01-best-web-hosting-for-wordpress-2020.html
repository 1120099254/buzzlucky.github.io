This will help you determine which one is the best for your website.<br /><br />SiteGround<br />Pros - It is recommended by Wordpress and easy to set up. They provide fast and reliable service. Most importantly, they provide a free SSL Certificate.<br />Cons - It is not the cheapest option out there. Their data plan also comes with a limit when it comes to how much you can upload on the server.<br /><br />Bluehost<br />Pros - It is also recommended by Wordpress. They are one of the most popular hosting sites because they pay a high affiliate commission.<br />Cons - It is a bit overpriced.<br /><br />GoDaddy<br />Cons - They are overpriced and there are no improvements in their product. It is fine for buying domain names only.<br /><br />A2 Hosting<br />Pros - They have one of the fastest server times. Their price is also pretty decent.<br />Cons - They are not the most reliable among all these companies.<br /><br />HostGator<br />Pros - This is a very popular hosting company. This is owned by the same parent company that owns Bluehost and they have similar features.<br />Cons - Unlike Bluehost, it is not recommended by Wordpress.<br /><br />WP Engine<br />Pros - They are one of the fastest and most reliable hosting sites. They also provide the best customer support.<br />Cons -  It is 10x more expensive than the other companies.<br /><br />InMotion<br />Cons - Their Uptime and Seed is mediocre. They are also expensive.<br /><br />Hostinger<br />Pros - One of the cheapest hosting sites out there. It is a great option for those with tight budgets.<br />Cons - You get what you pay for.<br /><br />DreamHost<br />Pros - It is also recommended by Wordpress like SiteGround and Bluehost.<br />Cons - It is more expensive than SiteGround and Bluehost with no added features.<br /><br /><br /><br />Instagram:@Travismarziani<br /><br />Tools I recommend:<br />Sign up using one of the links below and I will give you a free 1 on 1 consultation<br />Shopify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.effectiveecommerce.com/shopify">https://www.effectiveecommerce.com/shopify</a> <br />Onlinejobs.ph:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.effectiveecommerce.com/onlinejobs">https://www.effectiveecommerce.com/onlinejobs</a> <br />Bluehost: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.effectiveecommerce.com/bluehost">https://www.effectiveecommerce.com/bluehost</a><br />Assume all links in the video &amp; description are affiliate links and that by using them you are supporting the channel, so thank you!
