What do management consultants do day to day on the job? What's the actual role of a management consultant? What is the career progression in consulting?<br /><br />I break down the actual TASKS of what you will be doing as an entry level analyst / associate consultant, in your first few years of consulting. I also briefly touch upon consultant vs senior consultant vs manager vs director vs partner role expectations in consulting as well.<br /><br />In this video, I go through high level tasks and how you carry out those tasks will be dependent on what your client project is and what type of consulting you're doing. In your spare time, you'll do business development work for your team and of course, admin tasks to support your job. This is a peek into the day into the life of a consultant, into their actual roles! These activities are done in MBB consulting as well as Big 4 consulting. <br /><br />Want a 2 month FREE trial on Skillshare?
