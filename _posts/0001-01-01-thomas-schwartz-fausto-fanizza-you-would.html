Setting the mood perfectly in the mix, it's a skilled blend of moody atmospherics, drawing from classic progressive elements and deep house grooves, subtly wound together with melancholic vocals and piano melodies.<br /><br />&quot;Mad Dog&quot; steps up a gear, again combining dark tones with driving percussion in another sophisticated production. Delicate melodics make way for discordant strings and a surging bass riff as things build to an intense peak.<br /><br />Follow Anjunadeep:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.anjunadeep.com">http://www.anjunadeep.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/anjunadeep">http://www.facebook.com/anjunadeep</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/anjunadeep">http://www.twitter.com/anjunadeep</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/anjunadeep">http://www.instagram.com/anjunadeep</a><br />Google+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/deep-google‬">http://bit.ly/deep-google‬</a> <br />SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://soundcloud.com/anjunadeep">http://soundcloud.com/anjunadeep</a>
