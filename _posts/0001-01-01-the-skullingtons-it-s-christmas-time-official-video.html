The Skullingtons music video for &quot;It’s Christmas Time&quot;.<br /><br /><br />2020 has been a rough year for The Skullingtons. They got killed during the spring zombie apocolypse (they got better), recieving numerous Restraining Orders and lawsuits (for allegedly stalking and/or other creepy and macabre behaviour) and through all this, narrowly avoiding The Rona.  Now the Skullingtons boys have been reunited with their family and are preparing to celebrate a traditional Skullingtons Christmas in Hønefoss, Norway. The whole family is present and you are invited to join the festivities! <br />Presenting for the first time ever, we got the repressed Mommy Skullington, the salacious Daddy Skullington, the possible deceased Granny Skullington, the suicidal Little Sister Skullington and the zonked Uncle Skullington! With such a messed up family, no wonder the Skullington boys turned out the way the did. <br /><br /><br />We hope you enjoy celebrating Christmas with our happy family! <br /><br /><br />A special thanks goes out to supernumerary/make up artist/camerawoman extraordinare Inger Frøyshov for her much needed assistance.<br /><br /><br /><br />Merry Christmas and good fucking riddance to 2020!<br /><br /><br />Catch you guys on the other side!<br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />Directed, filmed, cut and edited by Rocky Skullington, with assistance from Inger Frøyshov.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Recorded, mixed and mastered by Jon Christoffer Sandstrøm (aka JC Skullington) at Blitz Lydstudio in Oslo.<br /><br /><br />The single will be available on all digital platforms November 27th.
