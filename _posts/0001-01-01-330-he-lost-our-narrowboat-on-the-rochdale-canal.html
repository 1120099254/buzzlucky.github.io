In todays vlog we continue up the Rochdale Canal out of Manchester. This part of the canal has a bit of a reputation for water shortages and antisocial behaviour. We had no shortage of water, there was plenty of it falling from the sky. We had a brilliant day and met some lovely people and can totally recommend the Rochdale Canal <br />_________________________________________________________________________<br />► MINIMAL LIST NAVIGABLE WATERWAYS MAP<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artbyannamarie.com/product-category/minimal-list/">https://artbyannamarie.com/product-category/minimal-list/</a><br /><br />► BIRMINGHAM CANAL NAVIGATIONS  MAP  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artbyannamarie.com/product-category/minimal-list/">https://artbyannamarie.com/product-category/minimal-list/</a><br /><br />► MINIMAL LIST T-SHIRTS &amp; MUGS      <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artbyannamarie.com/product-category/minimal-list/">https://artbyannamarie.com/product-category/minimal-list/</a><br />_________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />► Our Links<br />• BLOG•  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.minimallist.co.uk">http://www.minimallist.co.uk</a><br />•TWITTER•  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/nbminimallist">https://twitter.com/nbminimallist</a><br />• PATREON•  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/MINIMALLIST">https://www.patreon.com/MINIMALLIST</a><br />• FACEBOOK•  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/NBMinimalList/">https://www.facebook.com/NBMinimalList/</a><br />•INSTAGRAM• <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nbminimallist/">https://www.instagram.com/nbminimallist/</a><br />•ONE-OFF DONATION• paypal.me/NBMINIMALLIST<br />_________________________________________________________________________<br />► Jo wrote a short book about her travels and how she met Michael <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yaw8a7t3">https://tinyurl.com/yaw8a7t3</a><br />_________________________________________________________________________<br />► Michael's T-Shirt Shop<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.teepublic.com/user/yawpitchroll">https://www.teepublic.com/user/yawpitchroll</a><br />_________________________________________________________________________<br />► FAQ<br />Q• Why do you speed up some of the footage in your videos?<br />A• We don't, we film it as time-lapse footage. We do not have the battery capacity or data storage to film in real time as our cruises can last up to 7 or 8 hours. We use to the time-lapse footage to help tell the story of movement rather than showcase the scenery. We limit the amount of time-lapse shots we use in each vlog.<br /><br />Q• Why are the videos so behind?<br />A• This summer we decided we really wanted to just enjoy travelling on the boat. If we felt like cruising we would. It turened out we cruised a lot which meant we filmed more and had less time to edit. This meant the edits got really far behind. It was not intentional its just a consequence of us looking after our own mental health. Don't worry we are not rushing, we are just trying to enjoy the adventure.
