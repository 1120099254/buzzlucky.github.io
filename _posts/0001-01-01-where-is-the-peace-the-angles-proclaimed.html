Trisha Guise, Pastor<br /><br />Luke 2:13-14<br />13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, 14 “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”<br /><br />It’s important to understand that the peace the angels proclaimed was not a proclamation of world peace or a declaration that ends all wars. It was not a direct announcement that now we can get along with our neighbors. It’s actually much bigger and much more important than any of that. <br /><br />The angels declared that this peace belongs to those on whom God’s favor rests, those whom God is pleased with. So with whom is God pleased? Those who have placed their faith in His Son. <br /><br />But don’t get confused, this has nothing to do with our own doing. This has everything to do with what God is doing. God came to earth to live as a human being, God came to earth to die for our sins, and to rise again so that God could offer us His grace—His favor—wrapped up in the Gospel. This grace or deliverance isn’t from human enemies or sicknesses or anything of the sort; it is from the greatest enemy ever, SIN and its greatest consequence—death. When we believe in Jesus, we commit our life to Him rather than to your own way of living. And when do, God is pleased with us. His favor will rest on you.<br /><br />You will receive deliverance from sin and death. This is the Good News! This is the peace the angels were talking about.
