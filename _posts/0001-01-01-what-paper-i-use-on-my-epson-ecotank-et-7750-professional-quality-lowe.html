What's a good printer without good paper? Nothing <br />There are so many types of paper out there and you will not know which one fits your printing style(s) before trying them. I learned in the last 3 years that a good quality paper makes your photos or graphic designs to pop up. <br />-I use (Ultra) Premium Presentation Paper 8.5x11 / 11x14 / 11.7x16.5 <br />-HP Premium Presentation Paper 8.5x11 was my to go but it seems that they've discontinued it<br />Not printing photos but if I would do it, I would definetely choose the Red River Paper. How I found out what I like better? I just bought the sample box(~$14) and tried them all<br /><br />tiberiophotography.com<br />@tiberiophotography on Instagram<br /><br />Testing over 20 types on archival grade papers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXHtWcK1Igs&amp;t=1128s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXHtWcK1Igs&amp;t=1128s</a><br /><br />-PLEASE SUBSCRIBE-
